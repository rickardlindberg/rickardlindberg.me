Today's thought is about constant progress.

TDD is said to enable you to make constant progress. There is always a small
test that you can write that takes you in the direction you want to go. If you
are unsure about how to proceed, just write a tiny test and keep going from
there.

This was not working for me yesterday. In 25 minutes I was not able to make any
progress at all. I had written a test that showed some functionality that I
desired. Or thought I desired. For me, this particular problem is hard, so
knowing what next test to write is not always easy.

When it came to the implementation, it got even harder. I had no idea how to
make this test pass in the near future. Perhaps this was caused by me doing TDD
wrong and not following the transformation priority premise. Perhaps I was just
tired.

When the pomodoro finished, I didn't feel like I could make any more progress
today. At least not in front of the keyboard. But I couldn't let it go. So I
sat down with a pen and piece of paper and thought about the problem. I managed
to clarify some things for myself. It felt better.

Next time when I sit down at the computer, maybe I am better equipped to
continue solving this problem.
