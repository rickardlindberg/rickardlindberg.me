Today's thought is about how we learn to solve problems.

When we do code katas, we solve the same problem over and over again. We might
focus on practicing a particular aspect, but we still come up with a solution
to the same problem. After doing a code kata multiple times, we have probably
tried a few different solutions and come up with one that is our favourite.

Solving the same problem over and over again seems to be one way to find a
solution that we are happy about.

The question is if we can apply this problem solving strategy to production
code. When we are faced with a programming problem, what if we tried to solve
it a couple of times in different ways, evaluate the results, and proceed with
the solution we like the most?

When trying to solve a problem, we also learn more about the problem.

When trying to solve a problem, we should focus on the hardest part of the
problem. Or the most unknown part. We should strive to increase our confidence
that our solution will work.
