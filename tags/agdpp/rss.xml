    <title>Introducing Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Introducing Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</h1>

<p><em>Published on  9 April 2023.</em></p>

<p>I recently started playing computer games with my son. That sparked an interest in me to create a game myself that we can play together. Mostly because I think this will be a <strong>fun project</strong>, but also to show my son that you can actually make your own games. It’s not something that you <em>only</em> consume.</p>
<p>I thought I would also document this journey in a series of blog posts and videos.</p>

<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>The challenge is to create a game that me and my son will enjoy playing together.</p>
<h2 id="the-method">The method</h2>
<p>I want to develop this game using Agile methodology.</p>
<p>It means that instead of first figuring out what game I want to write, I will develop it incrementally and guide development by feedback.</p>
<p>It also means that I will rely heavily on self-testing code and TDD.</p>
<h2 id="my-background-in-games">My background in games</h2>
<p>I’m by no means an expert in creating games. I don’t even play games that much. But I have enjoyed creating some simple games in the past, like a Tetris clone and some kind of Asteroids.</p>
<p>I was actually able to restore an old copy of one of my Tetris games. It is written using Python and Pygame (which I also plan to use for my new game). I just needed to make a few small adjustments to make it work with Python 3. This is what it looks like:</p>

<h2 id="series-overview">Series overview</h2>
<p>So this series will cover how to create a game from the perspective of someone who has much experience programming, but not that much knowledge in the game domain.</p>
<p>Here is a list of topics off the top of my head that I imagine I will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game loop and how to test it</li>
<li>Can you really use TDD for games?</li>
<li>Learn to capture events from Logitech controller</li>
<li>How to come up with an idea for a game?</li>
<li>Performance: background erase vs redraw?</li>
<li>Resolution: what to choose?</li>
<li>How to incrementally develop a game idea?</li>
<li>Particle effects</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is just the beginning of my journey. I hope will enjoy following along.</p>
<p>See you in the next episode!</p>
