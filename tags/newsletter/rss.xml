    <description><![CDATA[<h1>June 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  4 July 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in June 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued writing about the development of the <a href="/projects/agdpp/index.html">balloon shooter game</a>. The actual development is already done, and I’m still playing catch up with the articles. Here are the ones that I wrote this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-tdd-and-games/index.html">Does TDD work when building a game?</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-spawn-multiple-balloons/index.html">Spawn multiple balloons</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-multiplayer/index.html">Multiplayer</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I had a discussion with <a href="https://www.ronjeffries.com/">Ron</a> about high-level vs micro-tests. I wrote about it in <a href="/writing/high-level-low-level-ron-reply/index.html">High-level or micro-tests? A discussion with Ron.</a></p></li>
<li><p>I couldn’t resist the <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@rickardlindberg/110447282439624451">urge</a> to start working on my own video editor software. I will write a blog post (or maybe a new series?) about it. In the meantime, the code is on <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlvideo">GitHub</a>. I am really not that good at naming my projects. They all start with “rl” plus the general function of the software:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rlvideo</code>: My video editor.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/rlmeta/index.html">rlmeta</a>: My meta compiler.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/rliterate/index.html">rliterate</a>: My literate programming tool.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/rlselect/index.html">rlselect</a>: My interactive line searcher tool.</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="/writing/newsletter/may-2023/index.html">Last month</a> I wrote about that I started a new project: animation studio. I have since successfully used it to create some animations for a video. Now that I’ve started working on my own video editor, I’m thinking that I want to integrate that functionality into the video editor instead of developing it further. We’ll see.</p></li>
<li><p>I published one programming video on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/unYD_bPyadc">Spawn multiple balloons | Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame (part 5)</a></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>May 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  6 June 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in May 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued working on the Balloon shooter game in my <a href="/projects/agdpp/index.html">Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</a> series. I wrote 6 blog posts about it! The blog posts are a bit behind development. I still have some catch up to do. One thing that I will probably cover later is how we recorded sound effects for shooting a balloon. Here are the blog posts I wrote this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-game-over/index.html">Game over?</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-hit-balloon-and-score-points/index.html">Hit balloon and score points</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-turning-arrow/index.html">Turning arrow</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-wrapper-pygame-draw-circle-bug/index.html">A case for the infrastructure wrapper</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-logitech-gamepad-f310/index.html">Programming a Logitech Gamepad F310</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-score-as-text/index.html">Score as text</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I started a new project: animation studio. The purpose is to be able to create animations programmatically for use in my videos. Things like text appearing and animating away. It has a preview mode where I can work on an animation, and when I am happy with the result, I can press a key to export a set of images that I can then import as a video in my video editor. I think the version I have now can actually be usable for some things. I will probably write more about it later. In the meantime, here is the project on <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/animate">GitHub</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote about <a href="/writing/how-to-test-a-router/index.html">how to test a router</a>. This is an example of how writing things down clarified my thinking and provided me with an answer. I’m glad I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>I published no videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>. Recently I’ve found it more valuable to blog. It is easier for me to write blogs and I think that I also find more value in going back to blogs (which are easily searchable). I think I will keep trying to make videos and find a good balance with blogging, but for now, I focus more on blogging.</p></li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>April 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  3 May 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in April 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished writing the blog post <a href="/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html">What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I started working on a game and am documenting the journey in a series called <a href="/projects/agdpp/index.html">Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</a>. This month I wrote 6 blog posts with 4 accompanying videos. It has been a lot of fun. Right now I’ve spend a little more time programming and a little less time writing, so I have some catch up to do.</p></li>
<li><p>I read a bit and thought a bit about the agile concept of a (user) story. I plan to clarify my thinking about stories by writing a blog post about it.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/UwYbSBUrotU">Ron Jeffries and Chet Hendrickson Live from Agile2017 - LeadingAgile Soundnotes</a>. The part that was most interesting to me (and my research about stories) was the idea that not everything the team does is on the backlog. Only stuff the PO cares about is on the backlog.</p></li>
<li><p>I spent some time reading articles on <a href="https://www.ronjeffries.com/">Ron’s site</a>. One favourite is <a href="https://www.ronjeffries.com/articles/-z022/0222ff/gotta-be-good/">Gotta Be Good</a>. Ron is also working on a game in Python which I tried and <a href="/writing/trying-rons-python-asteroids/index.html">wrote</a> about. His writing about his game development partly inspired me to do a similar series about my game.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another four programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/9DZ81lOPfmo">Introducing Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Q0347KVq7oU">Test driving the game loop | Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame (part 2)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/z20IocFrKLY">Demo and game idea | Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame (part 3)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/CfhEcp9Qghc">Shooting the arrow | Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame (part 4)</a></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>March 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 April 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in March 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I got interested in building a game using <a href="https://www.pygame.org">Pygame</a>. I’ve started playing computer games with my son, so I thought it would be a fun challenge to see if I can build a game that we both enjoy playing. I think this will be my next side project.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/guycIP56YeY">Kent Beck On The FIRST Testing Frameworks, TDD, Waterfall &amp; MORE | The Engineering Room Ep. 16</a>. Listening to Kent Beck is always interesting since many of the practices in the software world come from him.</p></li>
<li><p>I published no programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>. But I suspect upcoming ones will be about agile game development.</p></li>

    <title>February 2023 Update</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>February 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  5 March 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in February 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I started reading <a href="https://joyofagility.com/">Joy of Agility</a>. It has many interesting stories that provide valuable lessons.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued writing my blog post <a href="/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html">What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?</a>. I also asked for feedback on <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/">James’</a> Discord server and got many useful responses. In particular i learned about <a href="https://www.eficode.com/blog/pre-tested-integration">pre-tested integration</a> which looks very similar to what I tried to describe. I will update my blog post with feedback, and then I will call it done.</p></li>
<li><p>I <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@rickardlindberg/109846707922919650">asked Allen Holub</a> how to think about work that is not a story. Agile is about constantly providing value via stories, but what about work that needs to be done that doesn’t fit that category?</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/postscript-a-digital-printing-press/">PostScript: A Digital Printing Press</a>. It was a bit of computer history that I enjoyed.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another two programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/2VrKIIMTFUI">What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/_uB1KGPjJjw">How TDD helps me solve programming problems.</a></li>
</ul></li>

    <title>January 2023 Update</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>January 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on 11 February 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in January 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I started working on my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/projects">ideal code hosting platform</a>. I’ve attempted to do this once before and failed. I got the urge to give it another try. With my new experience of working in an agile way, I think my chance of succeeding this time is higher. But as always, you need to keep working on the project if it’s not going to die. Anyway, I am happy with the experience of trying and will for sure learn something.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/yXrY5pT88vA">AgileByExample 2021: J.B. Rainsberger - Unlocking the Awesome Power of Refactoring</a>. I learned about the idea of practice. If something you do regularly requires conscious brain effort, practice it until it becomes boring. That frees up brain capacity to think about more high-level problems.</p></li>
<li><p>I started reading <em>Extreme Programming Explained</em> (Second Edition) by Kent Beck. I wanted to learn more about XP since it seems to be the origin of “real” agile. I wanted to learn more about how accurate <a href="https://twitter.com/christianhujer/status/1614888741126176771">this tweet</a> was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• DevOps is just whole team+CI from XP.<br> • Teaming is whole team+pair programming from XP.<br> • TBD is just CI from XP.<br> • BDD is TDD+ATDD from XP.<br> <br> ⇒ 20+ years later, XP is still leading the way.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>I made some progress on my thinking about continuous integration and have a post about it in progress titled <a href="/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html">What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I published another two programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Hdg0LNga2dQ">My experience of one year on Youtube.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/ZvowW_toPmQ">How I start a new programming project. Building my ideal code hosting platform.</a></li>

    <title>December 2022 Update</title>
    <link>http://rickardlindberg.me/writing/newsletter/december-2022/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>December 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  9 January 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in December 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished writing my blog post <a href="/writing/evolving-design-of-projectional-editor/index.html">How should I evolve the design of my projectional editor?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I studied <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks">Testing Without Mocks: A Pattern Language</a> a bit more as James published a draft update of his article. I also watched some episodes of <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables-livestream">Nullables &amp; A-Frame Architecture Livestream</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I got the urge to build a new home for <a href="/projects/timeline/index.html">Timeline</a>. Many years ago a <a href="/writing/new-home-for-timeline/index.html">wrote</a> about what I want from a new home. I have tried building it once before but failed. Now with my updated knowledge of Agile development, I think I might be able to pull it off. (But most likely I will fail again. If I try.)</p></li>
<li><p>I solved Advent of Code <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17">day 17</a> and published my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/aoc/blob/main/2022/17.py">solution</a> on Github.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another two programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/PG3XvSd7Mns">This refactoring uncovered another problem.</a></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>November 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 December 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in November 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued programming on my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlproject">projectional editor</a>. I had so many ideas I wanted to try, but I got stuck with the design. I started writing a <a href="/writing/evolving-design-of-projectional-editor/index.html">blog post</a> explaining the problem. The blog post helped me get unstuck and I was able to move forward with my ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>I struggled with my writing in the before mentioned blog post. I got a <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@estherschindler/109424345364034217">tip</a> to read a book called “Bird by Bird”. It is a bit unlike other books I usually read in that it paints a picture of what it is like to be a writer. It doesn’t just give you the facts how to become a (better) writer. Sometimes I enjoy it and sometimes I just want the facts.</p></li>
<li><p>I created a Mastodon account to explore this other federated version of microblogging. You can find me at <a
href="https://hachyderm.io/@rickardlindberg"><span class="citation" data-cites="rickardlindberg">@rickardlindberg</span><span class="citation" data-cites="hachyderm.io">@hachyderm.io</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I published just one programming video on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/qa_2Bk4bLyw">My projectional editor can do this now?!</a></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>October 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on 10 November 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in October 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I started exploring projectional editing with <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlproject">rlproject</a>. For now, I’m trying to implement something like what <a href="https://github.com/projectured/projectured/wiki">ProjecturEd</a> describes in its documentation to learn how that might work.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/8Ab3ArE8W3s">“Stop Writing Dead Programs” by Jack Rusher (Strange Loop 2022)</a>. It showed what a better development environment might look like. It also showed that a projectional editor might make your program feel more alive than a plain text editor. Hillel Wayne <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/strangeloop-22/">points out</a> that the talk has factual errors. Nevertheless, I found it inspiring.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/Fk4rCn4YLLU">End to end functional tests that can run in milliseconds | Nat Pryce | CukenFest London 2017</a>. Nat showed an interesting approach to testing you application in a flexible way.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/9fJntxnH4wY">Pairin’ with Aaron: Messing with Language Servers</a>. I learned about languages servers (LPS’s) and their integration with the development environment.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched some episodes of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgt1lVMrdwlZKBaerxxp2iQ">Mob Mentality Show</a> and found them interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another four programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/DowzqlHr67k">Writing and testing a tiny application without mocks.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/3060LO0PZaY">I demo a tool that makes me super quick at the command line and more.</a></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>September 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  8 October 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in September 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finally finished writing <a href="/writing/reliable-socket-servers/index.html">How to write reliable socket servers that survive crashes and restarts?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/ulRCs7xQA74">Continuous Delivery vs. Gitflow &amp; CD At Scale | Bryan Finster In The Engineering Room Ep. 11</a>. In it, Bryan mention a metaphor with flying cards. The idea was that it is difficult to explain the concept of a flying car to someone who has never experienced it. It’s too foreign. I thought about how I could expose people to more “flying cars”. Make them experience TDD, CI/CD, etc, so that they never wanting to go back.</p></li>
<li><p>I think it was also in the video above that Dave said something along the lines that it’s amazing how much you start caring about testing if you are the one on call. That resonated with me. If you are responsible, you start caring. It also reminded me of another concept about how much to test, where the advice was something like test until fear turns into boredom. (I think I read it from <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrains">jbrains</a>, but <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrains/status/663451314341416960">it seems</a> to originally be from someone else.)</p></li>
<li><p>I published another five programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/tu3Sbm78SpY">How to write reliable socket servers that survive crashes and restarts?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/X5yIEELf4t0">What does working in small steps look like?</a></li>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in August 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I was interested in learning more how to slice stories to make them smaller but still valuable. I found Ron’s article <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/getting-small-stories/">Getting Small Stories</a> very useful. Having one “dumb” idea can change the conversation from “that is impossible” to “how can we make it better”.</p></li>
<li><p>I also read Ron’s book <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/rjnsd/the-nature-of-software-development/">The Nature of Software Development</a>. In it he talks about focusing on value and that value is something that <em>we want</em>. But who is <em>we</em>? When I am working on software that I use, I can ask myself what I want. But in most cases I’m not the only user of the software that I write. <em>We</em> are probably many different people.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve though about writing a book about how to implement programming languages. It would use <a href="/projects/rlmeta/index.html">RLMeta</a> for the examples. But writing a book seems like a daunting task. I started thinking that I could approach writing the book the same way I approach writing software in an agile fashion with small stories. I can create the first version of the “book” in one day. Then I can improve it by writing more chapters and going into more details.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued writing <a href="/writing/reliable-socket-servers/index.html">How to write reliable socket servers that survive crashes and restarts?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I watched the Mob Mentality Show <a href="https://youtu.be/nLUFPHUS2Pk">Agile vs. Agility with Allen Holub</a>. I’ve been inspired by Allen’s talk about Agile, and I got value from this episode.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another four programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/BXyiqhqXT0U">I did the simplest thing that could possibly work. Here’s what happened.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/XldYdxAlH2o">Converting RLCI to client/server architecture (part 1/3).</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/9HQB9pt4v30">Converting RLCI to client/server architecture (part 2/3).</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/GBfUerlQfuI">Converting RLCI to client/server architecture (part 3/3).</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>July 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 August 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in July 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued practicing Agile software development with <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlci/">RLCI</a>. I slowly get the feeling that Agile is not really what most people think it is. Some things I read and watched this month in that vein:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1546604233323032576">few</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1552432052762320896">tweets</a> by Allen Holub and a <a href="https://youtu.be/hxXmTnb3mFU">conversation</a> he had with Dave Farley gave me some insights into what “real” Agile is about.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sicpers.info/2022/07/phrases-in-computing-that-might-need-retiring/">Phrases in computing that might need retiring</a> by Graham Lee indicated to me that the term “Agile” has changed meaning over the years.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.ronjeffries.com/articles/-z022/0222ff/gotta-be-good/">Gotta Be Good</a> by Ron Reffries indicated to me that “real” Agile is actually HARD and need to be practiced to get good at.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I published another five programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/d7fq8JyU9jg">How to write tests that allow refactoring your code?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/BmUz4my7eko">Deploying my continuous integration software to a server.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/C05OD7h0-gg">Therapeutic refactoring and polishing of a feature.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/h_oRLiJo3Tc">How to incorporate evolutionary design into the development process?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/WlvsjCeuT6w">I made a mistake when evolving the design of RLCI to support a database.</a></li>
</ul></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>June 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  4 July 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in June 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I started over with <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlci/">RLCI</a> and tried to build it using an agile approach. The README has a bunch of more information about it. In this process, the following resources helped me:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2018/testing-without-mocks">Testing Without Mocks: A Pattern Language</a> Again from James Shore. Gave me insight into how to design and test.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/you-dont-hate-mocks-you-hate-side-effects">You Don’t Hate Mocks; You Hate Side-Effects</a> The following quote explained it well to me the design relationship between pure functions and functions with side effects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We always have the option of replacing a side-effect with returning a value that represents the effect, as long as we can instruct the clients to interpret that value as a command to execute.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/01/03/favor-real-dependencies-for-unit-testing/">Favor real dependencies for unit testing</a> This helped me solve a testing problem I had. More on that in an upcoming video.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I discovered that one of the authors of <em>Continuous Delivery</em>, Dave Farley, has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ContinuousDelivery">Youtube channel</a>. I found some of his videos interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another four programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/yKkGXn1zmaI">How James Shore ruined my RLCI project.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Re7litDdulU">Rebooting RLCI with an agile approach using TDD and zero friction development.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/sokSvnAkd5E">Adding continuous integration functionality to RLCI.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/0jJEPgomRCc">Making RLCI pipelines run in isolation.</a></li>
</ul></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>May 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  4 June 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in May 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I rediscovered James Shore through his <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2/book_club/evolutionary_design">Agile Book Club: Evolutionary Design (with Kent Beck)</a>. I had stumbled upon his <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/lunch-and-learn">TDD Lunch &amp; Learn</a> series before, and the book club made me revisit some of his work. This time I also bought his book <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2">The Art of Agile Development</a> which reignited my interest for agile methods (something that has diminished more and more since I first got into it).</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://alangrow.com/blog/dream-deploys-atomic-zero-downtime-deployments">Dream Deploys: Atomic, Zero-Downtime Deployments</a> and got inspired to try that approach. I also started working on a <a href="/writing/reliable-socket-servers/index.html">blog post</a> on my own to explore the topic.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued working on <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlci/">RLCI</a> and worked on connecting the different pieces. However, after getting inspired by agile methods again and learning that continuous integration is not what I thought it was (thanks for the inspiration James!), I will have to rethink the project. I think I will start over from scratch and develop it with a slightly new approach.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another four programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/R-HCtiVzYuI">Connecting all the pieces in RLCI.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/BQ-wWIVQ_gs">Researching zero downtime deployments.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/S_R80ZhsmZo">Getting back to the roots of TDD.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Xm8QGMzyxeI">Practicing TDD and testing without mocks.</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

    <title>April 2022 Update</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>April 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  1 May 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in April 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued working on <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlci/">RLCI</a>. In particular I started working on the server component and wrote it using <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html">asyncio</a>. So far, that feels like a good choice.</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/books/refactoringDatabases.html">Refactoring databases</a> and started reading <a href="https://www.martinfowler.com/books/nosql.html">NoSQL Distilled</a>. The reason I picked up the first one was that I sought to understand how you can do zero-downtime deployments and still evolve your database. That is, how can both an old version of an application and a new version of an application work with the same database? The answer was that you must evolve your database schema such that it is compatible with both versions. So if you move a column for example, you can create a trigger that make sure that both the old and the new column are in sync. And when a transition period is over, you can drop the old column, and the move column refactoring is complete. I picked up the second book to find if the answer was any different for NoSQL databases which generally are a bit more flexible when it comes to database schema. My guess is that a similar approach is needed. So far the book has given me some new ideas about what databases are for and how different databases serve different purposes. This will all be useful in going forward with a storage mechanism for RCLI.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another five programming videos on my Youtube channel:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/lqV5c_fN29Q">How to find time to work on your hobby projects?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/aXkGdvKZu1A">How I got unstuck with RLCI.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/GO-sfUaqbvg">Learning Python asyncio when working on CI server.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/ihS0HagBfKY">What makes programming videos interesting?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/uV2eeAcrxzU">Refactoring a class to test in isolation: REAL WORLD EXAMPLE</a></li>
</ul></li>
