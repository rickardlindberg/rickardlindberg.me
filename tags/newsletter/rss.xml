    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter February 2021</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 March 2021.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in February 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I recorded and published two videos where I hack on Smart Notes. In the <a href="https://youtu.be/yIeJYaht4RA">first</a> I fix a bug and in the <a href="https://youtu.be/uyRVhoWb4XY">second</a> I start implementing a new feature.</p></li>
<li><p>In the process of creating the videos, I also learned about video editing using <a href="https://shotcut.org/">Shotcut</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I finished the <a href="/writing/kinesis-advantage-2-swedish-setup/index.html">blog post</a> about the configuration of my Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard.</p></li>
<li><p>I played with <a href="https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/ssh/">Salt SSH</a>. I’ve used Ansible in the past and I wanted to explore Salt to see how it compared.</p></li>
<li><p>I read more about taking smart notes and the Zettelkasten method. In particular, I read a few articles on <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">zettelkasten.de</a> that helped me better understand some concepts.</p></li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter January 2021</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 February 2021.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in January 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh2bik1cOl0">video</a> demoing my note taking application. I have a few ideas of things I would like to improve in it. I’m thinking about recording some hacking sessions and publishing them. Let me know if you would be interested in that.</p></li>
<li><p>I created a simple HTML file upload form to learn more how file transfer over HTTP works. I have an idea for a different kind of CI system that I would like to try and implement. It is a big project and I’ve not committed to anything, so it will likely not happen anytime soon. But I’ve had the idea for a while and felt the urge multiple times to attempt to implement it. Anyway, file transfer over HTTP might be one part of that system.</p></li>
<li><p>I read parts of Clean Code again. Readability is important, but when reading the examples, I couldn’t help to think that no matter how clean we write our code, it would benefit from a description in prose as well. I’m thinking about Literate Programming. Why has it not caught on? Why is nobody using it? I might want to research this topic a bit. I have some practical experience with LP through RLiterate. Perhaps RLiterate can solve some problems with LP. At least it can be a playground for trying out new ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued work on the <a href="/writing/kinesis-advantage-2-swedish-setup/index.html">blog post</a> about the configuration of my Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard.</p></li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter December 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on  1 January 2021.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in December 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued work on the note taking application.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I added the remaining editing capabilities and also added a search feature so that any note could be found and opened. I am particularly happy with how the linking feature turned out. The application is now feature complete to the point where it is usable for me. I plan to do a video demo of it, so stay tuned for that.</p></li>
<li><p>I figured out how to properly use pygame and Pycairo together. I was mislead by the example in the Pycairo documentation, but eventually figured out how to do it for my particular use case. I might write about it in a blog post. Let me know if you would be interested in that.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I discovered <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ts8coMP645hZw9JSD3pqQ">Andreas Kling’s videos</a> where he hacks on his SerenityOS operating system. I have only watched a few, but I find them quite interesting.</p></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter November 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on  3 December 2020.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in November 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued work on the prototype of the note taking application.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I added navigation support and worked on the animations:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="smart-notes-navigation-animations.gif" />

</div></li>
<li><p>I added basic editing capabilities via an external editor. Now you can add a new note, add a new child note, and edit an existing note. Basic editing capabilities left to implement is linking two arbitrary notes and deleting links.</p></li>
<li><p>In addition to visual aspects, I also fleshed out the data model so that notes are read and written to file.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/why-i-still-use-vim/">Why I Still Use Vim</a>. The point being made is that that development tools must be easily customizable.</p></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter September 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on  3 October 2020.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in September 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I upgraded the configuration for my Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard. I am planning on writing a <a href="/writing/kinesis-advantage-2-swedish-setup/index.html">blog post</a> about it.</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://jessitron.com/2020/08/04/back-when-software-was-a-craft/">Back when software was a craft</a>. I feel that is true, and I miss the craft a bit. I can continue to craft in my spare time though.</p></li>
<li><p>I read the book <a href="https://takesmartnotes.com/">How to Take Smart Notes</a> by Sönke Ahrens. I found it very interesting and I am inspired to take better notes.</p></li>
<li><p>I read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Xanadu</a> since smart notes reminded me of it. Some ideas feel a bit similar.</p></li>
<li><p>I started prototyping a note taking application that follows some principles from the book. Here is a screenshot:</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter August 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on 13 September 2020.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in August 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I read about <a href="https://www.notion.so/Dango-b46c07f3dc224f968c768885abe70e70">Dango</a>. It is an example of a universal document type. It interested me because it seems related to ideas explored by <a href="http://vpri.org/">VPRI</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I blogged about the key takeaway that I got from reading <a href="/writing/bullet-journal-method-migration-as-review/index.html">The Bullet Journal Method</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched various videos by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/MattRagland">Matt Ragland</a> about journaling. He has been an inspiration to me in my bullet journal journey.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued with <a href="/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html">RLiterate 2</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I worked on adding toolbar actions for text editing:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="text-editing-toolbar.png" />

</div></li>
<li><p>I implemented splitting and joining a paragraphs with <code>Enter</code> and <code>Del</code>:</p>

</div></li>

    <title>Newsletter July 2020</title>
    <link>http://rickardlindberg.me/writing/newsletter/july-2020/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter July 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on  3 August 2020.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in July 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I read Atomic Habits by James Clear and blogged about the key takeaway that I got from reading it: <a href="/writing/atomic-habits-two-minute-rule/index.html">the two-minute rule</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I read The Bullet Journal Method by Ryder Carroll. I am planning to blog about the key takeaway that I got from reading it.</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://third-bit.com/2020/07/09/acm-sigsoft-award.html">Thoughts from a Not-So-Influential Educator</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, what would I change in 2020? First, I believe we should teach students design by having them study the great works of the past, just as other disciplines do. They should spend at least a full course reading code and building working models of common applications in order to become familiar with prior art and prior thinking. In their assignments, they should compare and contrast undo/redo handling in Emacs and Vim or the data structures beneath Git and Mercurial, or create programs like Mary Rose Cook’s <a href="http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/">Gitlet</a>, Matt Brubeck’s <a href="https://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html">layout engine</a>, or Conor Stack’s <a href="https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/">little database</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mentioned resources are interesting, and I want to study them more. It feels to me like simplified (but not dumbed down) versions of programs to understand them better. That approach feels interesting to me. Can we structure all programs in a similar way with a simple model/core and then addonds to make it more practically useful?</p></li>
<li><p>I played around with <a href="https://swaywm.org/">Sway</a>. As a big fan of <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3</a>, I’m looking for an alternative that works under Wayland as that seems to be the future. My conclusion is that Sway will probably work well for me.</p></li>
<li><p>I though about shooting some videos of <a href="/projects/rliterate/index.html">RLiterate</a> to demonstrate its features and show what I’m working on at the moment. Let me know if you would be interested in that.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued with <a href="/projects/rliterate/index.html">RLiterate</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I worked on an improved representation of selections.</p></li>
<li><p>I though about how to visualise a selection that is not active. Say you select some text and focus another application. What should happen to the selection? Grayed out? Disappear? Just hide the cursor? Different applications seem to handle this differently.</p></li>
<li><p>I though about when to clear the selection entirely? The obvious solution, now that I think about it, is to clear it when something else is selected. But what if the page that the selection is on disappears? How to notice that and clear selection?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

    <title>Newsletter June 2020</title>
    <link>http://rickardlindberg.me/writing/newsletter/june-2020/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter June 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on  6 July 2020.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in June 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I read parts of <a href="https://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/">Let’s Build a Compiler, by Jack Crenshaw</a>. It was interesting and it would be fun to try to implement the described language using <a href="/projects/rlmeta/index.html">RLMeta</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I read a few articles from Julia Evans that I found interesting:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/02/17/mystery-swap/">Swapping, memory limits, and cgroups</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/12/03/how-much-memory-is-my-process-using-/">How much memory is my process using?</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/10/10/what-even-is-a-container/">What even is a container: namespaces and cgroups</a></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I decided to have a look at <a href="/projects/rliterate/index.html">RLiterate</a> again.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued work on direct manipulation of text. Text in RLiterate is represented as a list of text segements with different styles. That structure has to be projected to the screen and edits have to go into the correct segement. Segments might be projected with some additional markup text that is not present in the text itself. So the problem is a little bit more involved than plain text editing. I’m struggling to solve this problem in an elegant way.</p></li>
<li><p>I have read about two so called projectional editors to get inspiration for how to solve these problems: <a href="https://github.com/projectured/projectured/wiki/Overview">ProjecturEd</a> and <a href="https://projectit-org.github.io/ProjectIt/projectit-component/0.0.4/index.html">ProjectIt</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>One particular problem I’m working on is how to represent selections. Today, a selection is both in the GUI domain and the document domain. If the selection is only in the document domain, then two selection markers can appear in GUI since the same page can be projected more than once onto the workspace. When I click a title for example, I want exactly that title to be selected, not the same underlying title on another projected page. What is a good representation of selections that take this into account?</p></li>
<li><p>I streamlined how props are generated. I wrote about the problem and my prefered pattern <a href="/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html#742ebf5ff2d8457ab8c01b3721052425">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I improved the performance of the text widget. When calculating where all characters will appear on the screen, you have to take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerning">kerning</a> into account. Previously that was done by calculating the bounding rectangle for consequtively longer substrings. For example: bounding rectangle for “H”, then bounding rectangle for “He”, and so on until “Hello”. Now only bounding rectangles for pairs of characters are calculated. So “He”, and “el”, “ll”, and “lo”. My guess (which seems to hold for now) is that kerning only affects two consecutive characters, in which case this optimization works. Since the number of pairs are limited by the alphabet, these calculations can also be cached.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter May 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on 13 June 2020.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in May 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I created a <a href="/pages/rlmeta-poster/index.html">poster</a> showcasing RLMeta and <a href="/writing/creating-rlmeta-poster/index.html">wrote</a> about it in a blog post. I am happy that I was able to improve both clarity and speed of RLMeta.</p></li>
<li><p>I started working on a <a href="/writing/rlmeta-poster2/index.html">second version</a> of the RLMeta poster. So far I’ve been able to resolve some of the issue from the first version (generate labels in actions, remove dependency on Bash) as well as other improvements.</p></li>
<li><p>Back in 2012 I <a href="/writing/reflections-on-programming/2012-08-30-learn-how-to-implement-languages/index.html">wrote</a> that it might be interesting to learn about techniques for creating programming languages. With RLMeta I have studied some of the suggested topics. It only took me like 8 years, but I’m happy to have finally done it.</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/12/08/babys-first-garbage-collector/">Baby’s First Garbage Collector</a>. After reading it I had the feeling that I could easily implement a garbage collector myself. I haven’t done it, but when I do, I will refer back to this blog post.</p></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter April 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on  4 May 2020.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in April 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished the blog post about <a href="/writing/wx-layout-update/index.html">Layout/Update problem in wxPython</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2020/04/05/crafting-crafting-interpreters/">Crafting “Crafting Interpreters”</a>. It was fun to read about his process of writing the book.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&amp;t=1843s">LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing Effectively</a>. Main takeaway was that the most important thing about writing is that it should be <strong>valuable</strong> to the reader. Everything else is secondary. A good structure to make it valuable is to first describe a problem (that the reader has) and then a solution.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnbVCNIh1NA">(ninth RacketCon): Andrew Blinn – Fructure: A Structured Editing Engine in Racket</a>. It inspired me.</p></li>

    <title>Newsletter March 2020</title>
    <link>http://rickardlindberg.me/writing/newsletter/march-2020/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter March 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 April 2020.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in March 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued with <a href="/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html">RLiterate</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I tried <a href="https://pavelfatin.com/typometer/">Typometer</a> to measure the time it takes from a kepress to a character appearing on the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>My first approach to speed up drawing was to draw immediately with <code>Layout</code>/<code>Update</code>. That turned out to not work so well. I documented the problem in a <a href="/writing/wx-layout-update/index.html">blog post</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I concluded that to draw fast in RLiterate, an approach that works quite well is to only draw the part where the cursor is first, and draw everything else a few milliseconds later if there are no additional input events. For example, if a title is edited in the workspace, the table of contents might have to be redrawn as well. But it can wait, since the focus is not on it right now. I documented this behavior quite well <a href="/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html#5fb3048d154d4f50af92d4cbe63db75a">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I think RLiterate’s true potential has not yet been explored. I think more paragraph types could add much value. It is something that I hope to explore after I finish RLiterate 2. But I don’t want to rush it. I want to write RLiterate 2 as clean as possible while still being capable of roughly what RLiterate (1) is.</p></li>
<li><p>I’m also thinking that RLiterate must be a multi process program. There is only so much you can do in GUI thread without it being sluggish. And using threads in Python does not help much since they are not truly run in parallell. So I’m thinking a multi process worker architecture is needed for heavy tasks. Like syntax highlighting, spell checking, generating files, etc. Then a little worker icon in toolbar to let the user know that stuff is happening in the background.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://medium.com/s/story/lets-pretend-this-never-happened-8abf0bc9648c">The Flawed History of Graphical User Interfaces</a>. Computers don’t have to be what they are. We can make them to do anything. Including alternative user interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://hackernoon.com/some-tentative-guidelines-for-gui-composability-2900abead1d9">Some tentative guidelines for GUI composability</a>. Isolated applications that can’t be composed is a bad idea. Yet the default.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pot9GnHFOVU&amp;t=1026s">Tudor Gîrba - Moldable development</a>. It is an interesting project that I want to explore more.</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://medium.com/feenk/one-rendering-tree-918eae49bcff">One rendering tree</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Well, the user interface framework has a tree, and somewhere in that tree, there is a canvas, and in that canvas … well, there is another world, with another tree. That these are different worlds, and different worlds means we cannot combine them easily. We do not want different worlds. We want just one. A seamless one.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is something that might be useful for RLiterate. But that would require yet another complete rewrite. I should finish RLiterate 2 and learn from it. Then study one rendering tree. Then see if a third rewrite is suitable or not. But it is far away in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/influential-dead-languages/">10 Most(ly dead) Influential Programming Languages</a>. I would like to learn more APL. Perhaps implement my own APL to learn more.</p></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter February 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 March 2020.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in February 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued with <a href="/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html">RLiterate</a> and made some <a href="/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html#416f6a8d52f0452ea3be94fd18b7a90e">progress</a>. I started to flesh out the rest of the application and started with adding support for direct manipulation of titles and paragraph text.</p></li>
<li><p>I found out about <a href="http://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/">Elastic tabstops - a better way to indent and align code</a>. It is a nice inspiration for tab stop handling in RLiterate.</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="http://blog.rfox.eu/en/Programmer_s_critique_of_missing_structure_of_oper.html">Programmer’s critique of missing structure of operating systems</a>. It reminds me of what Alan Kay has talked about and hints at what real objects might be like. Interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/826fd056-1d76-4b1c-b9c8-96deabbec07d">Donald Knuth Was Framed</a>. I’m interested in all sources about literate programming.</p></li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Newsletter January 2020</h1>

<p><em>Published on  3 February 2020.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in January 2020:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished the article about <a href="/writing/rlmeta-memoize-failures/index.html">memoizing failures in RLMeta</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I came across <a href="https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj">A Compiler Writing Journey</a>. It inspired me to write articles that explain things that I’m interested in.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU">“Hello, world” from scratch on a 6502 — Part 1</a>. Low level hardware is fun.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued with <a href="/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html">RLiterate</a> and made great <a href="/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html#bdeda63252d440c3b3394c34671a9107">progress</a>. I’m now confident that the new architecture will work. Now it’s just a matter of fleshing out the rest of the application until it can edit itself.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnqkglrSqrg&amp;t=2281s">Sean McDirmid - The Future of Programming will be Live - Curry On</a>. It made me think about introducing “Live examples” in RLiterate. If I have a function I want to add an example paragraph that executes that function and be able to modify its parameters interactively. Sort of like an interactive test case to explore input/output.</p></li>
<li><p>I read about <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> <a href="https://github.com/pshrmn/notes/blob/master/redux/redux.md">here</a> and <a href="https://randycoulman.com/blog/2016/11/22/taking-advantage-of-combinereducers/">here</a>. Its architecture can be an inspiration for how to handle state in RLiterate.</p></li>
