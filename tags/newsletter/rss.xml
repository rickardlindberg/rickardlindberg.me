<p>This is what I’ve been up to in January 2024:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried to solve <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> day 21, part 2, but failed. I decided to stop here for now. I will perhaps give it another try next year.</li>

    <title>December 2023 Update</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>December 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 January 2024.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in December 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This month I’ve been all consumed by <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>. This year was the first year that I tried to solve all puzzles from beginning to end. At the time of this writing, I have completely solved day 1-20 and part 1 of day 21.</p></li>
<li><p>I solved all puzzles in my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/linda-meta-oop">experimental programming language</a>. One reason I did that was to see how good a fit the language was and also get feedback on how the language could be improved to be a better fit for a broader range of problems.</p></li>
<li><p>The Advent of Code experience has been as expected: fun, challenging, frustrating, and stressful. The most fun thing I learned was an algorithm for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon">filling polygons</a>. It was useful for two problems, but only fast enough for one.</p></li>
<li><p>The experience of developing my language at the same time has also been fun, but the pressure of completing the puzzles has given me less focus on the language itself. But I managed to add some features to the language that were direct needs that came up when solving the puzzles. One was a simple, built-in test framework. Another was nicer syntax. Most of the time though, it was not limitations in the language that made solving the puzzles hard. However, sometimes the solution would have been more straightforward in a better suited language.</p></li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>November 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on 12 December 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in November 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued work on my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/linda-meta-oop">experimental programming language</a> which is based on <a href="/writing/rlmeta/index.html">RLMeta</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I did more research on the paradigm of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)">Linda programming language</a> and how it would fit together with RLMeta.</p></li>
<li><p>I started evolving the RLMeta implementation to support the paradigm of Linda. I realized that RLMeta could itself be implemented in this paradigm and started to evolve the code base in that direction.</p></li>
<li><p>I plan on solving <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> puzzles using this language to see how problems from different domains can be expressed.</p></li>
<li><p>I really should document this language and my work on it better.</p></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>October 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  6 November 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in October 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Somehow videos from <a href="https://computerhistory.org/">Computer History Museum</a> showed up in my Youtube feed and I once again got sucked into the world of <a href="/writing/alan-kay-notes/index.html">Alan Kay</a> and Smalltalk. Here are (some of?) the videos that I watched:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/PaOMiNku1_M">CHM Live | Making Smalltalk</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/loEREmEPEOY">CHM Live | Making Smalltalk: Member Event</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/uknEhXyZgsg">Alto System Project: Dan Ingalls demonstrates Smalltalk</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I found the <a href="https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-08">Byte Magazine Volume 06 Number 08 - Smalltalk</a> online which covers many topics from Smalltalk. So interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>I played with some Smalltalks from <a href="https://smalltalkzoo.thechm.org/">the Smalltalk zoo</a>, and also with <a href="https://squeak.org/">Squeak</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I played with RLMeta and worked on a <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlmeta/tree/main/simpler_base">simpler base version</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Revisiting Alan Kay, I once again was inspired by his ideas. What triggered it this time was re-watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhOHn9TClXY">Joe Armstrong &amp; Alan Kay - Joe Armstrong interviews Alan Kay</a>. In it, he mentions the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)">Linda programming language</a> and how it relates to META II (which I’ve previously explored in <a href="/projects/rlmeta/index.html">RLMeta</a>). I decided to try to explore those ideas further in a new project: <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/linda-meta-oop">https://github.com/rickardlindberg/linda-meta-oop</a>. Perhaps more to come there soon.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/CmIGPGPdxTI">Is Software Engineering Real Engineering? • Hillel Wayne • YOW! 2023</a>. What I remember from it now is that other engineering disciplines envy that software engineering has version control.</p></li>
<li><p>I had the realization that creating a DSL <em>might</em> be like science. You observe how a certain problem is solved or how a certain thing works. Then you try to <strong>describe</strong> that <strong>phenomena</strong> in a new language, the <strong>DSL</strong>. Then you make it run by <strong>writing a compiler</strong>. The new language allow people to solve problems that they might not have been able to do before. It allows them to think in a different way. The group of people who can <strong>create</strong> a DSL is most likely smaller than the group of people who can do useful work with one. Similar to how many people can use math today to solve useful problems, but might not have been able to invent math itself.</p></li>
</ul>

    <title>September 2023 Update</title>
    <link>http://rickardlindberg.me/writing/newsletter/september-2023/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>September 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on 10 October 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in September 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I wrote another devlog about my <a href="/writing/devlog-013-raspberrypi-game-console/index.html">Raspberry Pi game console</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gib0hKYjB0">Continued Learning: The Beauty of Maintenance - Kent Beck - DDD Europe 2020</a>. What stuck in my mind was the metaphor that software development is like a swan. You can watch the beauty as it moves across the water. That represents the behavior of the software system. The features. But to make that happen, lots of things is going on under the surface that you don’t see. The swan paddles its feet (?) to go forward, poop comes out, it is messy. That is the structural changes needed in software to make the features possible. Refactoring.</p></li>
<li><p>I started reading <a href="https://www.davefarley.net/?p=352">Modern Software Engineering</a> by Dave Farley. So far, I’ve gotten a few useful ideas out of it.</p></li>
<li><p>When I started reading about software engineering, <a href="/writing/alan-kay-notes/index.html">Alan Kay</a> came to mind again. I revisited some of his talks, trying to find things about science and engineering in particular. I admire Alan’s work, and I also like the Agile concepts that Dave talks about. I’m interested in figuring out if they contradict, or if I can happily continue to admire both.</p></li>
<li><p>When reading about Alan Kay again, Bret Victor came to mind, and I watched his talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agOdP2Bmieg">The Humane Representation of Thought</a>. I feel like his and Kay’s work are worth revisiting from time to time. For inspiration for better ways of doing things. And for inspiration of things to try to do differently.</p></li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>August 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  4 September 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in August 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued writing <a href="/tags/devlog/index.html">DevLogs</a>. All about the development of my <a href="/projects/rlvideo/index.html">video editor</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote the perhaps <a href="/writing/agdpp-the-end/index.html">final article</a> in my <em>Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</em> series. I will most like continue the series in the form of DevLogs.</p></li>
<li><p>I decided that I need to use more of my free time for other things than programming. I still want to continue writing though but, most likely, program a bit less.</p></li>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in July 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued work on my <a href="/projects/rlvideo/index.html">video editor</a>. Here is the initial blog post about it: <a href="/writing/writing-my-own-video-editor/index.html">Writing my own video editor</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I started writing <a href="/tags/devlog/index.html">DevLogs</a>. DevLogs is an experiment to try to document development that I do on various projects. I will try to write what is going on in my head as I do various development tasks. So far, they have all been about development of the video editor.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote a blog post called <a href="/writing/fast-feedback-on-graphical-code/index.html">How to get fast feedback on graphical code?</a> I share a technique that I started using while developing the video editor.</p></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>June 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  4 July 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in June 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued writing about the development of the <a href="/projects/agdpp/index.html">balloon shooter game</a>. The actual development is already done, and I’m still playing catch up with the articles. Here are the ones that I wrote this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-tdd-and-games/index.html">Does TDD work when building a game?</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-spawn-multiple-balloons/index.html">Spawn multiple balloons</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-multiplayer/index.html">Multiplayer</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I had a discussion with <a href="https://www.ronjeffries.com/">Ron</a> about high-level vs micro-tests. I wrote about it in <a href="/writing/high-level-low-level-ron-reply/index.html">High-level or micro-tests? A discussion with Ron.</a></p></li>
<li><p>I couldn’t resist the <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@rickardlindberg/110447282439624451">urge</a> to start working on my own video editor software. I will write a blog post (or maybe a new series?) about it. In the meantime, the code is on <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlvideo">GitHub</a>. I am really not that good at naming my projects. They all start with “rl” plus the general function of the software:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rlvideo</code>: My video editor.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/rlmeta/index.html">rlmeta</a>: My meta compiler.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/rliterate/index.html">rliterate</a>: My literate programming tool.</li>
<li><a href="/projects/rlselect/index.html">rlselect</a>: My interactive line searcher tool.</li>
<li>…</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><a href="/writing/newsletter/may-2023/index.html">Last month</a> I wrote about that I started a new project: animation studio. I have since successfully used it to create some animations for a video. Now that I’ve started working on my own video editor, I’m thinking that I want to integrate that functionality into the video editor instead of developing it further. We’ll see.</p></li>
<li><p>I published one programming video on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/unYD_bPyadc">Spawn multiple balloons | Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame (part 5)</a></li>

    <title>May 2023 Update</title>
    <link>http://rickardlindberg.me/writing/newsletter/may-2023/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>May 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  6 June 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in May 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued working on the Balloon shooter game in my <a href="/projects/agdpp/index.html">Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</a> series. I wrote 6 blog posts about it! The blog posts are a bit behind development. I still have some catch up to do. One thing that I will probably cover later is how we recorded sound effects for shooting a balloon. Here are the blog posts I wrote this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-game-over/index.html">Game over?</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-hit-balloon-and-score-points/index.html">Hit balloon and score points</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-turning-arrow/index.html">Turning arrow</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-wrapper-pygame-draw-circle-bug/index.html">A case for the infrastructure wrapper</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-logitech-gamepad-f310/index.html">Programming a Logitech Gamepad F310</a></li>
<li><a href="/writing/agdpp-score-as-text/index.html">Score as text</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I started a new project: animation studio. The purpose is to be able to create animations programmatically for use in my videos. Things like text appearing and animating away. It has a preview mode where I can work on an animation, and when I am happy with the result, I can press a key to export a set of images that I can then import as a video in my video editor. I think the version I have now can actually be usable for some things. I will probably write more about it later. In the meantime, here is the project on <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/animate">GitHub</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I wrote about <a href="/writing/how-to-test-a-router/index.html">how to test a router</a>. This is an example of how writing things down clarified my thinking and provided me with an answer. I’m glad I did it.</p></li>
<li><p>I published no videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>. Recently I’ve found it more valuable to blog. It is easier for me to write blogs and I think that I also find more value in going back to blogs (which are easily searchable). I think I will keep trying to make videos and find a good balance with blogging, but for now, I focus more on blogging.</p></li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>April 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  3 May 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in April 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished writing the blog post <a href="/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html">What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I started working on a game and am documenting the journey in a series called <a href="/projects/agdpp/index.html">Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</a>. This month I wrote 6 blog posts with 4 accompanying videos. It has been a lot of fun. Right now I’ve spend a little more time programming and a little less time writing, so I have some catch up to do.</p></li>
<li><p>I read a bit and thought a bit about the agile concept of a (user) story. I plan to clarify my thinking about stories by writing a blog post about it.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/UwYbSBUrotU">Ron Jeffries and Chet Hendrickson Live from Agile2017 - LeadingAgile Soundnotes</a>. The part that was most interesting to me (and my research about stories) was the idea that not everything the team does is on the backlog. Only stuff the PO cares about is on the backlog.</p></li>
<li><p>I spent some time reading articles on <a href="https://www.ronjeffries.com/">Ron’s site</a>. One favourite is <a href="https://www.ronjeffries.com/articles/-z022/0222ff/gotta-be-good/">Gotta Be Good</a>. Ron is also working on a game in Python which I tried and <a href="/writing/trying-rons-python-asteroids/index.html">wrote</a> about. His writing about his game development partly inspired me to do a similar series about my game.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another four programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/9DZ81lOPfmo">Introducing Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Q0347KVq7oU">Test driving the game loop | Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame (part 2)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/z20IocFrKLY">Demo and game idea | Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame (part 3)</a></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>March 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 April 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in March 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I got interested in building a game using <a href="https://www.pygame.org">Pygame</a>. I’ve started playing computer games with my son, so I thought it would be a fun challenge to see if I can build a game that we both enjoy playing. I think this will be my next side project.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/guycIP56YeY">Kent Beck On The FIRST Testing Frameworks, TDD, Waterfall &amp; MORE | The Engineering Room Ep. 16</a>. Listening to Kent Beck is always interesting since many of the practices in the software world come from him.</p></li>
<li><p>I published no programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>. But I suspect upcoming ones will be about agile game development.</p></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>February 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  5 March 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in February 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I started reading <a href="https://joyofagility.com/">Joy of Agility</a>. It has many interesting stories that provide valuable lessons.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued writing my blog post <a href="/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html">What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?</a>. I also asked for feedback on <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/">James’</a> Discord server and got many useful responses. In particular i learned about <a href="https://www.eficode.com/blog/pre-tested-integration">pre-tested integration</a> which looks very similar to what I tried to describe. I will update my blog post with feedback, and then I will call it done.</p></li>
<li><p>I <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@rickardlindberg/109846707922919650">asked Allen Holub</a> how to think about work that is not a story. Agile is about constantly providing value via stories, but what about work that needs to be done that doesn’t fit that category?</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://computerhistory.org/blog/postscript-a-digital-printing-press/">PostScript: A Digital Printing Press</a>. It was a bit of computer history that I enjoyed.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another two programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/2VrKIIMTFUI">What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/_uB1KGPjJjw">How TDD helps me solve programming problems.</a></li>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in January 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I started working on my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/projects">ideal code hosting platform</a>. I’ve attempted to do this once before and failed. I got the urge to give it another try. With my new experience of working in an agile way, I think my chance of succeeding this time is higher. But as always, you need to keep working on the project if it’s not going to die. Anyway, I am happy with the experience of trying and will for sure learn something.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/yXrY5pT88vA">AgileByExample 2021: J.B. Rainsberger - Unlocking the Awesome Power of Refactoring</a>. I learned about the idea of practice. If something you do regularly requires conscious brain effort, practice it until it becomes boring. That frees up brain capacity to think about more high-level problems.</p></li>
<li><p>I started reading <em>Extreme Programming Explained</em> (Second Edition) by Kent Beck. I wanted to learn more about XP since it seems to be the origin of “real” agile. I wanted to learn more about how accurate <a href="https://twitter.com/christianhujer/status/1614888741126176771">this tweet</a> was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• DevOps is just whole team+CI from XP.<br> • Teaming is whole team+pair programming from XP.<br> • TBD is just CI from XP.<br> • BDD is TDD+ATDD from XP.<br> <br> ⇒ 20+ years later, XP is still leading the way.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>I made some progress on my thinking about continuous integration and have a post about it in progress titled <a href="/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html">What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I published another two programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Hdg0LNga2dQ">My experience of one year on Youtube.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/ZvowW_toPmQ">How I start a new programming project. Building my ideal code hosting platform.</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>December 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  9 January 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in December 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished writing my blog post <a href="/writing/evolving-design-of-projectional-editor/index.html">How should I evolve the design of my projectional editor?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I studied <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks">Testing Without Mocks: A Pattern Language</a> a bit more as James published a draft update of his article. I also watched some episodes of <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables-livestream">Nullables &amp; A-Frame Architecture Livestream</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I got the urge to build a new home for <a href="/projects/timeline/index.html">Timeline</a>. Many years ago a <a href="/writing/new-home-for-timeline/index.html">wrote</a> about what I want from a new home. I have tried building it once before but failed. Now with my updated knowledge of Agile development, I think I might be able to pull it off. (But most likely I will fail again. If I try.)</p></li>
<li><p>I solved Advent of Code <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17">day 17</a> and published my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/aoc/blob/main/2022/17.py">solution</a> on Github.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another two programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/PG3XvSd7Mns">This refactoring uncovered another problem.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/AuuLTUSfBjs">How blogging helped me solve a programming problem.</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

    <title>November 2022 Update</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>November 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 December 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in November 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued programming on my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlproject">projectional editor</a>. I had so many ideas I wanted to try, but I got stuck with the design. I started writing a <a href="/writing/evolving-design-of-projectional-editor/index.html">blog post</a> explaining the problem. The blog post helped me get unstuck and I was able to move forward with my ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>I struggled with my writing in the before mentioned blog post. I got a <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@estherschindler/109424345364034217">tip</a> to read a book called “Bird by Bird”. It is a bit unlike other books I usually read in that it paints a picture of what it is like to be a writer. It doesn’t just give you the facts how to become a (better) writer. Sometimes I enjoy it and sometimes I just want the facts.</p></li>
<li><p>I created a Mastodon account to explore this other federated version of microblogging. You can find me at <a
href="https://hachyderm.io/@rickardlindberg"><span class="citation" data-cites="rickardlindberg">@rickardlindberg</span><span class="citation" data-cites="hachyderm.io">@hachyderm.io</span></a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I published just one programming video on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/qa_2Bk4bLyw">My projectional editor can do this now?!</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
