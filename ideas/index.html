<p>Implement minimal OOP-language in the same fashion as Lua.</p>
<hr />
<p>Different coordinate systems are suited to different problems. Choosing the right coordinate system makes the problem easier to solve. The same should be true for programming problems. Each problem probably has an ideal programming language in which it can be solved. The task for a programmer should be to find that language, implement it, and solve the problem in that language. Try to find and document examples of this hypothesis.</p>
<p>The ideal language is found if no accidental complexity is present when the problem is solved in that language. That will also make the problem be expressed in few lines of code. So a crude metric of good software is its size. Or rather its size for the functionality it gives.</p>

<p>The goal of a free software community should be to maximize the number of contributors. It is first about community, second about the product.</p>

<p>Quotes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somewhere in all of this, I realized that the bridge to an object-based system could be in terms of each object as a syntax directed interpreter of messages sent to it. In one fell swoop this would unify object-oriented semantics with the ideal of a completely extensible language. The mental image was one of separate computers sending requests to other computers that had to be accepted and understood by the receivers before anything could happen. In today’s terms every object would be a server offering services whose deployment and discretion depended entirely on the server’s notion of relationship with the servee.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Again, the whole point of OOP is not to have to worry about what is inside an object. Objects made on different machines and with different languages should be able to talk to each other—and will have to in the future. Late-binding here involves trapping incompatibilities into recompatibility methods—a good discussion of some of the issues is found in [Popek 1984].</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Staying with the metaphor of late-binding, what further late-binding schemes might we expect to see? One of the nicest late-binding schemes that is being experimented with is the metaobject protocol work at Xerox PARC [Kiczales 1991]. The notion is that the language designer’s choice for the internal representation of instances, variables, etc., may not cover what the implementer needs, so within a fixed semantics they allow the implementer to give the system strategies—for example, using a hashed lookup for slots in an instance instead of direct indexing. These are then efficiently compiled and extend the base implementation of the system.</p>

<p>Erlang / FP / OOP:</p>
<p>Concurrent system must use multiple computers. Multiple computers must communicate with message passing.</p>
<p>Why not program “local” system with that model as well?</p>
<p>Like many small computers (or objects) communicating with eachother by message passing.</p>
<p>How are messages represented in Erlang? Does a message send work exactly the same no matter if the receiver is on the same computer or not?</p>

<p><a href="http://lists.squeakfoundation.org/pipermail/squeak-dev/1998-October/017019.html">prototypes vs classes was: Re: Sun’s HotSpot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just a gentle reminder that I took some pains at the last OOPSLA to try to remind everyone that Smalltalk is not only NOT its syntax or the class library, it is not even about classes. I’m sorry that I long ago coined the term “objects” for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the lesser idea.</p>
<p>The big idea is “messaging” – that is what the kernal of Smalltalk/Squeak is all about (and it’s something that was never quite completed in our Xerox PARC phase).</p>

<hr />
<p>Interesting quotes from <a href="http://www.purl.org/stefan_ram/pub/doc_kay_oop_en">Dr. Alan Kay on the Meaning of “Object-Oriented Programming”</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought of objects being like biological cells and/or individual computers on a network, only able to communicate with messages (so messaging came at the very beginning – it took a while to see how to do messaging in a programming language efficiently enough to be useful).</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to get rid of data. The B5000 almost did this via its almost unbelievable HW architecture. I realized that the cell/whole-computer metaphor would get rid of data, and that “&lt;-” would be just another message token (it took me quite a while to think this out because I really thought of all these symbols as names for functions and procedures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The original Smalltalk at Xerox PARC came out of the above. The subsequent Smalltalk’s are complained about in the end of the History chapter: they backslid towards Simula and did not replace the extension mechanisms with safer ones that were anywhere near as useful.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>OOP to me means only messaging, local retention and protection and hiding of state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things. It can be done in Smalltalk and in LISP. There are possibly other systems in which this is possible, but I’m not aware of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interesting quotes from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19415983">Hacker News thread</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Containers are a validation of Kay’s idea that sharing encapsulated objects is easier than sharing data.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because a lot of people (including me) have a Simula based view of “object oriented”, we tend to think of objects as data structures with functions attached to them. Alan Kay had a different view, as far as I can tell. He viewed objects as being a collection of abilities. You could invoke these abilities by sending the object a “message”. How you send that message is irrelevant. The important thing is that the object is not a collection of data, but rather the object contains the program state necessary to provide the ability (and nothing more). One of the things he talks about (I can’t remember if he does in this specific email exchange, though) is the idea that once the data is inside the object, you can’t actually access it any more. It becomes a detail that the programmer doesn’t have to worry about.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Smalltalk had to cut corners with messaging due to the limited processing of the time, nevertheless it has fully reified messages; one can express the sending of messages between objects.</p>
<p>Smalltalk inspired Erlang, which is the fully-asynchronous messaging/independent threads of execution part of OO only.</p>
<p>Self did OO without inheritance (composition by prototypes).</p>

<p>SICP modeling data with functions:</p>

<p><code>pair</code> is an object that responds to messages (‘0’ and ‘1’).</p>
<p>In this setup it is impossible to get the individual coordinates without sending a message. True encapsulation of state.</p>
