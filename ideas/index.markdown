Different coordinate systems are suited to different problems. Choosing the
right coordinate system makes the problem easier to solve. The same should be
true for programming problems. Each problem probably has an ideal programming
language in which it can be solved. The task for a programmer should be to find
that language, implement it, and solve the problem in that language. Try to
find and document examples of this hypothesis.

The ideal language is found if no accidental complexity is present when the
problem is solved in that language. That will also make the problem be
expressed in few lines of code. So a crude metric of good software is its size.
Or rather its size for the functionality it gives.
