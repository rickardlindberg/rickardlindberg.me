I recently read *The Bullet Journal Method* by Ryder Carroll. In this post I
will write about the key takeaway that I got from reading it. If you want a
full book review, you can for sure find it somewhere else online.

Bullet journaling is a specific way of using a plain notebook as a journal and
planner. One part of the system is writing down tasks. Each day you start on a
blank page and write down the tasks that you want to accomplish that day. If
the previous day had unfinished tasks, you can migrate those tasks. Then you
copy them over to the current day by writing them again.

Why is this different from just keeping a todo list? The difference is that
every day (or at whichever interval you choose to migrate tasks) you get to
decide what is most important that day. You start fresh and get a chance to
review tasks and decide if they are still important or not.

The recurring reflection on what is important was the key takeaway that I got
from reading the book.

I have tried bullet journalling now for about one month and might write more
about my experiences.
