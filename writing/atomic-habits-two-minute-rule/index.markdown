I recently read Atomic Habits by James Clear. In this post I write about
the key takeway that I got from reading it. There were many interesting
topics, but I will focus on the one that had the biggest impact on me. If you
want a full book review, you can for sure find it somewhere else online.

So, for me, the key takeway was what James calls the **Two-Minute Rule**.  It
states that "When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes
to do."

Two minutes don't sound like much. Say I want to build a habit of exercising
daily. If I just to it for two minutes, will it really have any effect? But the
point is not to do the habit for two minutes. The point is to make the habit as
easy as possible to start. The first step of exercising might be to change into
workout clothes. That might take two minutes. Then your time is up. So if you
just do that, you won't get much exercising done. But what you do is build the
habit of showing up for exercise. You slowly start to become a person who is
ready for exercise. Once you have changed into workout clothes it is so much
easier to do some exercise.

I find this rule helpful in many situations where I have trouble starting. I
might have a big project that I don't really know how to make progress on or
want to work on. Then it helps me to think about something small that I can do
to make progress. Instead of having a goal of completing the project I just
have the goal of showing up and making progress somehow for two minutes.

I have tried this in practice and it really works. Sometimes I have ended up
working in very short bursts. Perhaps a little longer than two minutes, but
still not long. I for sure didn't complete the project. But I kept doing it.
Working in small chunks. Making small progress. And eventually the project got
completed. I like this focus on the process of making progress instead of the
end goal itself. If you improve your process, the results will take care of
themselves.

For example writing this blog post. I put it off for a while because it felt
like a too big project to tackle and waited for enough energy to take it on.
Eventually I told myself that I could make some progress by just collecting a
few notes. I told myself that was the only thing I had to do. It would take
perhaps 10 minutes. It's not hard, I can do that. And after I had done it, I
felt like starting doing some writing on the post as well. So I did. And then
all of a sudden I had made some progress on something that felt difficult.
Just by focusing on the first two minutes.
