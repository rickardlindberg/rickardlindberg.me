* What should a CI server do?
* Main branch working (at all times)
* Integrate means to merge your changes into the main branch.
* code works on one machine but not on another

* use of CI vs continuous integration

* know about vcs

I've thought a lot about continuous integration lately. I've tried to find the
root of the practice, and James' book and articles have been really helpful
for that. It seems to me that many tools used for CI makes it difficult to do CI
well.

I've thought about what a CI server *should* do and written about it in a blog
post. I would love to get your feedback on my thinking. In particular I'm
interested in knowing if you agree with me on what a CI server should do. The
draft of the blog post is here:
