**This is a work in progress that will change. Like to see it finished? Let me know by sending me an email.**

I recently started playing computer games with my son. That sparked an interest
in me to create a game myself that we can play together. Mostly because I think
this will be a **fun project**, but also to show my son that you can actually
make your own games. It's not something that you *only* consume.

I thought I would also document this journey in a series of blog posts and
videos.

## The challenge

The challenge is to create a game that me and my son will enjoy playing
together.

## The method

I want to develop this game using Agile methodology.

It means that instead of first figuring out what game I want
to write, I will develop it incrementally and guide development by feedback.

It also means that I will rely heavily on self-testing code and TDD.

## My background in games

I'm by no means an expert in creating games. I don't even play games that much.
But I have enjoyed creating some simple games in the past, like a Tetris clone
and some kind of Asteroids.

I was actually able to restore an old copy of one of my Tetris games. It is
written using Python and Pygame (which I also plan to use for my new game). I
just needed to make a few small adjustments to make it work with Python 3. This
is what it looks like:

## Series overview

So this series will cover how to create a game from the perspective of someone
who has much experience programming, but not that much knowledge in the game
domain.

Here is a list of topics off the top of my head that I imagine I will cover:

* Game loop and how to test it
* Can you really use TDD for games?
* Learn to capture events from Logitech controller
* How to come up with an idea for a game?
* Performance: background erase vs redraw?
* Resolution: what to choose?
* How to incrementally develop a game idea?

This list is just the beginning of my journey. I hope will enjoy following
along.

See you in the next episode!
