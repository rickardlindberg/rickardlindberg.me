CHANGES:

* Adapt to Python 3.

* PyVM (first version)

    *   Split PyVM into parser and codegenerator.

    *   Two passes (and thus two grammars) are needed if macros should be
        possible to define last.

    *   What is a good AST for PyVM?

    [x] Continue to build parse tree.

    [x] Figure out how to replace support library in make.py

* Rename match -> matches in Scope

TODO:

[ ] Better error message than None if runtime/scope is not found.

    * Immutable scope instead and fail if entry does not exist?

[ ] Put compile + error reporting function in support lib.

[ ] First parameter to Scope should really be "matches"
