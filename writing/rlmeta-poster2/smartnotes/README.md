CHANGES:

* Adapt to Python 3.

* PyVM (first version)

    *   Split PyVM into parser and codegenerator.

    *   Two passes (and thus two grammars) are needed if macros should be
        possible to define last.

    *   What is a good AST for PyVM?

    [x] Continue to build parse tree.

    [x] Figure out how to replace support library in make.py

[x] Better error message than None if runtime/scope is not found.

    * Rename match -> matches in Scope
    * Immutable scope instead and fail if entry does not exist?

[x] Generate instruction "enum" so that strings don't have to be used

[x] Counter class is more clean

* No need to wrap parser output in list for codegenerator in RLMeta

[x] Put compile + error reporting function in support lib.

[x] No need to wrap parser output in list for codegenerator in PyVM

[x] You can put any crap at end of file, and parsers don't care. Fix it!

[x] VM should not know about runtime.

[x] Move "assembly" out of support library. Grammar should generate
    labels/instructions.

TODO:

[ ] Support recursive macros?

    * Probably requires function to run grammar against an object

[ ] No failure if VM-compilation fails? (Swap Instruction arguments.)
