I've been on a quest to learn "real agile". Before I researched
[CI](/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html). Now its time for user
stories.

## TODO

https://ronjeffries.com/articles/-y023/python/-w030/038/

What people say a story is:

...

"Do you put backlog refinement on the backlog?"

XP: "Write stories about improving your software development process. What is
your budget for improvement?"

...

What value? To whom?

...

Ron: "What kinds of value does your project deliver to its users? To your
organization? To the team? What value does it deliver to you?"

Information has value. (Spike solution.)

...

Acceptance test: when is a story done?

...

Adding features/capabilities to product needs story? Refacotring does not add
any ability? Testing neither. Both increase quality, but not capability.

...

Example: SSL certs

Example: Testing

Example: Moving hosting provider

...

AI chronicels: stories show progress towards a larger goal.
