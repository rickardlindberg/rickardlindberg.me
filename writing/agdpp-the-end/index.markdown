**This is a work in progress that will change. Like to see it finished? Let me know by sending me an email.**

When I started this series, my intention was to document my journey of creating
a game using agile methods.

I think I have mostly succeeded in this regard, but at the moment I've done
some development that I have not documented. Furthermore, I did that
development many months ago, so documenting it gets harder and harder because I
forget what I was thinking when I did the development.

Recently though, I've experimented with a new format which I call DevLogs. It
is basically the same thing but a little less polished. I write a DevLog while
doing the development, so there is no risk of falling behind.

In this post I will briefly mention the development that I've done but not
documented and talk a little about future plans.

## Summary

This post probably marks the end of this series as we know it.  When I continue
this project, it will be in the form of a [DevLog](/tags/devlog/index.html).
See you there!
