Thoughts on TDD.
How I use TDD.
What TDD means to me.
Explain why I do TDD.

* I want an oracle that tells me if the change is good or not. Self testing
  code.

* Emery on Test Automation.

* jbrains advice on TDD.

* Start with my toot:

* Example: How to do the design change I did with rlproject with TDD?
  Impossible.
* Safety net analogy. They bounce off each other. SelfTesting code.
* THINK. The first step in TDD?

  Solution to the problem "what test do I write?"
    * James Shore has a THINK step
        * 4 steps in TDD

I did not use TDD for design, I used writing and thinking. At least for the
big picture. Then TDD helped me move there.

    Think -> What test to write

Maybe this is test driving. Just one dumb test after another. Just learn what
you need, one tiny test at a time.

Am I learning the design aspect of TDD just now?!

Maybe not according to jbrains.

Maybe I just sneaked up on a solution slowly.

On the other hand, thinking is not forbidden in TDD. And if writing gives
better thinking, is it thinking or writing?

    Wow! This is how you do TDD.
