## Introduction

In this post I will explore formal languages. As I explore different aspects, I
will write about them. This post will grow over time.

## What is a formal language?

A formal language is a language that can be precisely defined.

## Grammar

A grammar defines what strings are valid in a formal language. It defines what
syntactically correct strings look like. It does not say anything about
meaning. Grammars are themselves typically expressed in a formal language.
