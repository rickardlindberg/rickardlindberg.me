        <h1>Writing a real application in Haskell</h1>

<p><em>Published on  5 February 2012.</em></p>

<p>In this post I explain why I choose to write the <a href="../../../writing/reflections-on-programming/2012-01-11-application-development-series-intro/">file organization application</a> in Haskell.</p>
<h2 id="getting-away-from-oop">Getting away from OOP</h2>
<p>I’ve spent most of my time programming in object oriented languages, but I’ve also been interested in functional programming ever since I was introduced to Lisp at university.</p>
<p>It was in the Lisp course that I first learned about recursion (or at least came to understand it), and it also taught me a lot about programming in general.</p>
<p>The solutions that we wrote had a different structure from what I was used to. I remember them as powerful and elegant. Somehow that elegance never made it outside the university and the Lisp course. That makes me a little sad.</p>
<p>One big reason I find object oriented programs hard to understand is mutable state. Since that is less of a problem in functional programs, I keep thinking that functional programming must be better. Or at least yield less complicated programs.</p>
<p>The paper <a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf">Why Functional Programming Matters</a> also makes some compelling cases for functional programming.</p>
<p>So how come it’s not used mainstream?</p>
<p>Is it because it doesn’t work in practice or is it because it’s so fundamentally different that people are not willing to wrap their heads around it?</p>
<p>I decided it was time for me to find out by trying to write a real application in a functional language.</p>
<h2 id="why-haskell">Why Haskell?</h2>
<p>I wanted to write a real application in a functional language. But why Haskell?</p>
<p>I came across Haskell by accident. Because I was learning <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>, I was reading <a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/">Mercurial: The Definitive Guide</a>, written by Bryan O’Sullivan. I found out that he had also co-authored the book <a href="http://book.realworldhaskell.org/">Real World Haskell</a>. Since I liked his first book, I started reading the one about Haskell.</p>
<p>I found Haskell interesting for two reasons: you can obviously build real things in it (and I had a book to show me how), and it’s a purely functional language.</p>
<p>Building real things was important because I didn’t just want to play around in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a>. Purely functional was important so that had to force myself to adopt the functional paradigm.</p>
<p>Another feature that makes Haskell different is lazy evaluation. It’s a feature that allows programs to be structured in a way that would otherwise be impractical. It’s also stated as one of the two advantages of functional programming in the paper mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>By writing the application in Haskell, I’m exploring a different way of structuring my programs. I’m expecting to learn a lot, and I will share what I learn on this blog.</p>
