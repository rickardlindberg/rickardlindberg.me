      <h1>DevLog 010: Debugging MLT/GTK segfault</h1>

<p><em>Published on  3 August 2023.</em></p>

<p>I try to edit some footage with my <a href="../../projects/rlvideo/">video editor</a>. Actually, it is footage from <a href="../../writing/devlog-009-improve-timeline-scrubbing/">DevLog 009</a> that I hope to put together. Everything is going quite well. After I add a split-cut-at-playhead operation to the editor, in addition to the previously added ripple delete, I am actually able to do some useful edits.</p>
<p>However, after a while I notice that a cut does not seem to render the correct frame. I decide to restart the application, and then it happens. Segfault!</p>
<p>This time, the segfault reproduces consistently. I’m excited to debug this and see how we can resolve it. I’ve got my cup of coffee, and I’m ready to go.</p>

<p>Because this is not the first time I see segfaults in this application, I have added a command to run the application in GDB. Here is how to use it:</p>

<h2 id="analysis-and-ideas">Analysis and ideas</h2>
<p>The segfault seems to happen inside some Cairo drawing code. That is most likely happening because GTK is trying to show a widget that tries to draw itself. I think GTK calls were further down in the backrace.</p>
<p>I find it very unlikely that this can happen from the Python GTK bindings. My suspicion is that this has something to do with MLT. Why? Because the segfault only happens for some projects.</p>
<p>I know that many MLT calls return status codes that I never check. Perhaps I should.</p>
<p>There is also a way to serialize an MLT producer to an XML file which can then be played with <code>melt</code>. That way we can see if MLT has the same problems as we are having given the same MLT producer.</p>
<p>This might be useful for other types of debugging as well.</p>
<p>Let’s see if we can implement that XML export and see if <code>melt</code> segfaults as well or if that works.</p>

<p>Hmm. Now I’m not using the project that I had problems with. Now I’m just using the default test project which works fine otherwise.</p>
<p>When I look closer at the profile in the XML file, other things seem off as well. The width and height don’t seem to be correct either. I try to use the project profile instead of the preview profile in the XML export code. This works better. However, the player only shows a couple of frames where there should be more. What is going on?</p>
<p>Then I notice this at the end of the XML file:</p>

<p>The export works fine and it plays fine in the <code>melt</code> player.</p>
<p>I think that the fixes we made for the XML export only affects the XML export. But it is nice that we now have the ability to play our projects with <code>melt</code>. I suspect it might come in handy in the future as well.</p>
<p>So there doesn’t seem to be anything wrong with the producer that we create. Melt can play it just fine. That is good news, I guess, but what to do next?</p>
<h2 id="weird-cuts">Weird cuts</h2>
<p>I mentioned in the beginning that the reason that I restarted the application was that I thought a cut rendered the wrong frame.</p>
<p>I see this problem when playing the XML file with melt as well.</p>
<p>This is most likely something wrong in our code. However, it doesn’t seem to contribute to the segfault.</p>
<p>I add a TODO in the code in a place where I think the problem is. Let’s deal with that later. We are on the hunt for segfault reasons now.</p>
<h2 id="more-ideas">More ideas</h2>
<p>We have concluded that the producer that we create is probably fine.</p>
<p>My suspicion is that there is something in the combination of MLT and GTK that causes the segfault. MLT and GTK are running in the same process, so it might be possible that they interfere with each other somehow. The backtrace got segfaulted inside the pthread library. So perhaps this is also timing related.</p>
<p>Let’s try a few things out.</p>
<h2 id="removing-the-player">Removing the player</h2>
<p>The thing that connects MLT and GTK is the player. We start an MLT SDL consumer and have it display it’s output in a GTK window.</p>
<p>I try to remove the player like this:</p>
<div class="rliterate-code">
<div class="rliterate-code-body">
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span></span><span class="c1">#mlt_player = MltPlayer(self.project, preview.get_window().get_xid())</span>

</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And now the application starts!</p>
<p>But of course it doesn’t work properly.</p>
<p>However, it tells me that there is something about this combination that causes the segfault.</p>
<h2 id="timing">Timing</h2>
<p>I then try this:</p>

<p>That is, I create the MLT consumer a little later, once GTK has had time to start up a bit more.</p>
<p>And wow, this actually works!</p>
<p>I though about this idea because I had come across this comment in the <a href="https://github.com/jliljebl/flowblade">Flowblade</a> source code:</p>
<div class="rliterate-code">

<p>The comment was for SDL2, and we are using SDL1, but I thought it was worth a try anyway.</p>
<p>Here is one reason that I think it is valuable documenting my work. I was able to get an idea from Flowblade. From a comment written in the source code. That was valuable to me. Maybe others will find similar value in what I write about. Maybe.</p>
<h2 id="solution-too-soon">Solution too soon?</h2>
<p>I try the <code>idle_add</code> solution a couple of times, and it seems like I was too fast to declare victory. It seems like it still segfaults sometimes.</p>

<p>And it still segfaults sometimes.</p>
<h2 id="delay-all-mlt-operations">Delay all MLT operations</h2>
<p>I’m thinking that we need to delay all MLT operations until GTK is properly initialized.</p>
<p>I try to get this to work, but I don’t manage. The code is too tangled together.</p>
<p>Many hours pass, and I don’t seem to be making any progress.</p>
<h2 id="overlap">Overlap</h2>
<p>I’m thinking that this segfault might have to do with the bug I talked about in the beginning about the wrong frame being rendered.</p>
<p>I find the problem in the code, write a test that exposes the bug, and then fix it.</p>
<p>That was good, but it did not resolve the segfault.</p>
<p>I keep scratching my head, thinking of things to try. Hours pass. Then I have a breakthrough.</p>
<h2 id="breakthrough">Breakthrough</h2>
<p>But some lucky guess, I find out that the segfault only happens when we have overlapping clips in our project. I decide to comment out transitions (the code that merges multiple, overlapping frames together), and suddenly, the reproducible segfault goes away. The problem seems to be with the <code>qtblend</code> transition. There is another one called <code>frei0r.cairoblend</code> which works as well for our purposes. I switch to that one and write this comment in the code about it.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I am extremely satisfied that we found the reason for the segfault and were able to fix it.</p>
<p>In the process we also found a couple of other bugs that we fixed and added the XML export for easier debugging.</p>
<p>After fixing the segfault I continue to edit. Unfortunately, I get other segfaults now. This time not reproducible, but more random. I conclude that I must learn better the internals of MLT to figure out what I’m doing wrong in the Python code. And after the things I learned from this session, I’m more prepared.</p>
