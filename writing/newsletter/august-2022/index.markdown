This is what I've been up to in August 2022:

* I was interested in learning more how to slice stories to make them smaller
  but still valuable. I found Ron's article [Getting Small
  Stories](https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/getting-small-stories/) very
  useful. Having one "dumb" idea can change the conversation from "that is
  impossible" to "how can we make it better".

* I also read Ron's book [The Nature of Software
  Development](https://pragprog.com/titles/rjnsd/the-nature-of-software-development/).
  In it he talks about focusing on value and that value is something that *we
  want*. But who is *we*? When I am working on software that I use, I can ask
  myself what I want. But in most cases I'm not the only user of the software
  that I write. *We* are probably many different people.

* I've though about writing a book about how to implement programming
  languages. It would use [RLMeta](/projects/rlmeta/index.html) for the
  examples. But writing a book seems like a daunting task. I started thinking
  that I could approach writing the book the same way I approach writing
  software in an agile fashion with small stories. I can create the first
  version of the "book" in one day.  Then I can improve it by writing more
  chapters and going into more details.

* I continued writing [How to write reliable socket servers that survive
  crashes and restarts?](/writing/reliable-socket-servers/index.html)

* I watched the Mob Mentality Show [Agile vs. Agility with Allen
  Holub](https://youtu.be/nLUFPHUS2Pk). I've been inspired by Allen's talk
  about Agile, and I got value from this episode.

* I published another four programming videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):

  * [I did the simplest thing that could possibly work. Here's what happened.](https://youtu.be/BXyiqhqXT0U)
