This is what I've been up to in May 2024:

* I made a video and blog post about [refactoring a function to 6
  classes](/writing/function-to-oop-refactoring/index.html).

* I continued writing on the blog post about [output tracking vs
  mocks](/writing/output-tracking-vs-mocks/index.html).

* I started working on a new project:
  [RIDE](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/ride/). The goal is to create an
  IDE that suites my needs. Most likely, the project will not be successful,
  but it's fun trying. The firsts component I started working on was a file
  tree where the whole structure is always shown. If it doesn't fit on the
  screen, the text get smaller, and you can magnify parts of the tree by
  hoovering it.

* I watched [Bootstrapping Research & Dynamicland, Dec
  2019](https://youtu.be/eJm44LJDU44). The idea of physical programming
  intrigued me.
