This is what I've been up to in May 2023:

* I continued working on the Balloon shooter game in my [Agile Game
  Development with Python and Pygame](/projects/agdpp/index.html) series. I
  wrote 6 blog posts about it! The blog posts are a bit behind development. I
  still have some catch up to do. One thing that I will probably cover later is
  how we recorded sound effects for shooting a balloon. Here are the blog posts
  I wrote this month:

    * [Game over?](/writing/agdpp-game-over/index.html)
    * [Hit balloon and score points](/writing/agdpp-hit-balloon-and-score-points/index.html)
    * [Turning arrow](/writing/agdpp-turning-arrow/index.html)
    * [A case for the infrastructure wrapper](/writing/agdpp-wrapper-pygame-draw-circle-bug/index.html)
    * [Programming a Logitech Gamepad F310](/writing/agdpp-logitech-gamepad-f310/index.html)
    * [Score as text](/writing/agdpp-score-as-text/index.html)

* I started a new project: animation studio. The purpose is to be able to
  create animations programmatically for use in my videos. Things like text
  appearing and animating away. It has a preview mode where I can work on an
  animation, and when I am happy with the result, I can press a key to export a
  set of images that I can then import as a video in my video editor. I think
  the version I have now can actually be usable for some things. I will
  probably write more about it later. In the meantime, here is the project on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/animate).

* I wrote about [how to test a
  router](/writing/how-to-test-a-router/index.html). This is an example of how
  writing things down clarified my thinking and provided me with an answer.
  I'm glad I did it.

* I published no videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA). Recently
  I've found it more valuable to blog. It is easier for me to write blogs and I
  think that I also find more value in going back to blogs (which are easily
  searchable). I think I will keep trying to make videos and find a good
  balance with blogging, but for now, I focus more on blogging.
