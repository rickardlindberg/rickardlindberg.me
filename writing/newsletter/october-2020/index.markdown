This is what I've been up to in October 2020:

* I continued work on the prototype of note taking application.

    * I made the lines between notes look nicer:

    * I started experimenting with variable sized notes depending on mouse
      cursor position:

* I read [The context in which we build
  software](https://thorstenball.com/blog/2020/09/15/the-context-in-which-we-build-software/).
  I reflected that one programmer's advice might not be applicable to another
  programmer.
