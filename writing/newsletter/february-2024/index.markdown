This is what I've been up to in February 2024:

* For the first time since I started writing these newsletters in [June
  2019](/writing/newsletter/june-2019/index.html) I haven't really got anything
  to write here. Even though I've been busy with other things in previous
  months as well, I've usually done something related to programming that is
  worth writing about. But not this month.

* Oh, wait. I did actually browse through a book about Smalltalk and though
  about how it was way ahead of its time and that we still lack things in our
  development environments that were present in Smalltalk.
