This is what I've been up to in November 2022:

* I continued programming on my [projectional
  editor](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlproject). I had so many ideas I
  wanted to try, but I got stuck with the design. I started writing a [blog
  post](/writing/projectional-editor-design-limit/index.html) explaining the
  problem. The blog post helped me get unstuck and I was able to move forward
  with my ideas.

* I struggled with my writing in the before mentioned blog post. I got a
  [tip](https://hachyderm.io/@estherschindler/109424345364034217) to read a
  book called "Bird by Bird". It is a bit unlike other books I usually read in
  that it paints a picture of what it is like to be a writer.  It doesn't just
  give you the facts how to become a (better) writer. Sometimes I enjoy it and
  sometimes I just want the facts.

* I created a Mastodon account to explore this other federated version of
  microblogging. You can find me at <a

* I published just one programming video on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):
