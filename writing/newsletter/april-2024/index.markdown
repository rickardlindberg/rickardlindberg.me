This is what I've been up to in April 2024:

* I started writing about [Output Tracking vs
  Mocks](/writing/output-tracking-vs-mocks/index.html) (working title). I'm
  mainly writing it to refine my thinking on [Testing Without
  Mocks](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables/testing-without-mocks)
  patterns.

* I watched [Moving IO to the edges of your app: Functional Core, Imperative
  Shell - Scott Wlaschin](https://youtu.be/P1vES9AgfC4). In it, Scott says that
  the functional core should return a decision that is then executed by the
  imperative shell. I want to explore that approach more. Perhaps in the above
  mentioned blog post.
