This is what I've been up to in September 2022:

* I finally finished writing [How to write reliable socket servers that survive
  crashes and restarts?](/writing/reliable-socket-servers/index.html)

* I watched [Continuous Delivery vs. Gitflow & CD At Scale | Bryan Finster In
  The Engineering Room Ep. 11](https://youtu.be/ulRCs7xQA74). In it, Bryan
  mention a metaphor with flying cards. The idea was that it is difficult to
  explain the concept of a flying car to someone who has never experienced it.
  It's too foreign. I thought about how I could expose people to more "flying
  cars". Make them experience TDD, CI/CD, etc, so that they never wanting to go
  back.

* I think it was also in the video above that Dave said something along the
  lines that it's amazing how much you start caring about testing if you are
  the one on call. That resonated with me. If you are responsible, you start
  caring. It also reminded me of another concept about how much to test, where
  the advice was something like test until fear turns into boredom. (I think I
  read it from [jbrains](https://twitter.com/jbrains), but [it
  seems](https://twitter.com/jbrains/status/663451314341416960) to originally
  be from someone else.)

* I published another five programming videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):

  * [How to write reliable socket servers that survive crashes and restarts?](https://youtu.be/tu3Sbm78SpY)
  * [What does working in small steps look like?](https://youtu.be/X5yIEELf4t0)
  * [Are you running your tests often enough?](https://youtu.be/IWAx1-thc_w)
  * [My continuous integration workflow.](https://youtu.be/1bDEHWKjbyQ)
  * [My workflow for making changes to software.](https://youtu.be/kdYE7_9-5Ng)
