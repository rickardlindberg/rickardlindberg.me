This is what I've been up to in February 2020:

* I continued with [RLiterate](/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html) and made
  some
  [progress](/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html#416f6a8d52f0452ea3be94fd18b7a90e).
  I started to flesh out the rest of the application and started with adding
  support for direct manipulation of titles and paragraph text.

* I found out about [Elastic tabstops - a better way to indent and align
  code](http://nickgravgaard.com/elastic-tabstops/). It is a nice inspiration
  for tab stop handling in RLiterate.

* I read [Programmer's critique of missing structure of operating
  systems](http://blog.rfox.eu/en/Programmer_s_critique_of_missing_structure_of_oper.html).
  It reminds me of what Alan Kay has talked about and hints at what
  real objects might be like. Interesting.

* I read [Donald Knuth Was
  Framed](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/826fd056-1d76-4b1c-b9c8-96deabbec07d).
  I'm interested in all sources about literate programming.
