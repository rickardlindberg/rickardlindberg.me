This is what I've been up to in May 2022:

* I rediscovered James Shore through his [Agile Book Club: Evolutionary Design
  (with Kent
  Beck)](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2/book_club/evolutionary_design).
  I had stumbled upon his [TDD Lunch &
  Learn](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/lunch-and-learn) series before,
  and the book club made me revisit some of his work. This time I also bought
  his book [The Art of Agile
  Development](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2) which reignited my
  interest for agile methods (something that has diminished more and more since
  I first got into it).

* I read [Dream Deploys: Atomic, Zero-Downtime
  Deployments](https://alangrow.com/blog/dream-deploys-atomic-zero-downtime-deployments)
  and got inspired to try that approach. I also started working on a [blog
  post](/writing/reliable-socket-servers/index.html) on my own to explore the
  topic.

* I continued working on [RLCI](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlci/) and
  worked on connecting the different pieces. However, after getting inspired by
  agile methods again and learning that continuous integration is not what I
  thought it was (thanks for the inspiration James!), I will have to rethink
  the project. I think I will start over from scratch and develop it with a
  slightly new approach.

* I published another four programming videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):

    * [Connecting all the pieces in RLCI.](https://youtu.be/R-HCtiVzYuI)
    * [Researching zero downtime deployments.](https://youtu.be/BQ-wWIVQ_gs)
    * [Getting back to the roots of TDD.](https://youtu.be/S_R80ZhsmZo)
    * [Practicing TDD and testing without mocks.](https://youtu.be/Xm8QGMzyxeI)
