This is what I've been up to in November 2021:

* I managed to do a little more writing on the
  [RLMeta](/writing/rlmeta-poster2/index.html) blog post. Not as much as I had
  hoped, but I plan to continue working on it in December.

* Since I started getting interested in cameras and making videos, my spare
  time, and perhaps also interest, for programming has decreased. It is still a
  big interest of mine, so I don't think it has gone away. I have mostly made
  videos for myself, but perhaps I can combine my two interests and make
  programming videos of some sort.

* I got an email from someone with a question about my article on [compiling
  expressions to x86 machine code](/writing/expr-to-x86-compiler/index.html). I
  don't often get any feedback on my blog posts, but whenever I do, I get happy
  because then it feels like someone appreciated what I did.
