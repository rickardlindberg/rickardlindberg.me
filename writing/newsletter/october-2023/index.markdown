This is what I've been up to in October 2023:

* Somehow videos from [Computer History Museum](https://computerhistory.org/)
  showed up in my Youtube feed and I once again got sucked into the world of
  [Alan Kay](/writing/alan-kay-notes/index.html) and Smalltalk. Here are (some
  of?) the videos that I watched:

    * [CHM Live | Making Smalltalk](https://youtu.be/PaOMiNku1_M)
    * [CHM Live | Making Smalltalk: Member Event](https://youtu.be/loEREmEPEOY)
    * [Alto System Project: Dan Ingalls demonstrates Smalltalk](https://youtu.be/uknEhXyZgsg)

* I found the [Byte Magazine Volume 06 Number 08 -
  Smalltalk](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-08) online which
  covers many topics from Smalltalk. So interesting.

* I played with some Smalltalks from [the Smalltalk
  zoo](https://smalltalkzoo.thechm.org/), and also
  with [Squeak](https://squeak.org/).

* I played with RLMeta and worked on a [simpler base
  version](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlmeta/tree/main/simpler_base).

* Revisiting Alan Kay, I once again was inspired by his ideas. What triggered
  it this time was re-watching [Joe Armstrong & Alan Kay - Joe Armstrong
  interviews Alan Kay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhOHn9TClXY).  In it, he
  mentions the [Linda programming
  language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language)) and
  how it relates to META II (which I've previously explored in
  [RLMeta](/projects/rlmeta/index.html)). I decided to try to explore those
  ideas further in a new project:
  [https://github.com/rickardlindberg/linda-meta-oop](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/linda-meta-oop).
  Perhaps more to come there soon.

* I watched [Is Software Engineering Real Engineering? • Hillel Wayne • YOW!
  2023](https://youtu.be/CmIGPGPdxTI). What I remember from it now is that
  other engineering disciplines envy that software engineering has version
  control.

* I had the realization that creating a DSL *might* be like science. You
  observe how a certain problem is solved or how a certain thing works. Then
  you try to **describe** that **phenomena** in a new language, the **DSL**.
  Then you make it run by **writing a compiler**. The new language allow people
  to solve problems that they might not have been able to do before. It allows
  them to think in a different way. The group of people who can **create** a
  DSL is most likely smaller than the group of people who can do useful work
  with one. Similar to how many people can use math today to solve useful
  problems, but might not have been able to invent math itself.
