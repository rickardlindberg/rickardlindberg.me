This is what I've been up to in August 2023:

* I continued writing [DevLogs](/tags/devlog/index.html). All about the
  development of my [video editor](/projects/rlvideo/index.html).

* I wrote the perhaps [final article](/writing/agdpp-the-end/index.html) in my
  *Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame* series. I will most like
  continue the series in the form of DevLogs.

* I decided that I need to use more of my free time for other things than
  programming. I still want to continue writing though but, most likely,
  program a bit less.
