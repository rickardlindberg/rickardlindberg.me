This is what I've been up to in February 2021:

* I recorded and published two videos where I hack on Smart Notes. In the
  [first](https://youtu.be/yIeJYaht4RA) I fix a bug and in the
  [second](https://youtu.be/uyRVhoWb4XY) I start implementing a new feature.

* In the process of creating the videos, I also learned about video editing
  using [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/).

* I finished the [blog
  post](/writing/kinesis-advantage-2-swedish-setup/index.html) about the
  configuration of my Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard.

* I played with [Salt SSH](https://docs.saltproject.io/en/latest/topics/ssh/).
  I've used Ansible in the past and I wanted to explore Salt to see how it
  compared.

* I read more about taking smart notes and the Zettelkasten method. In
  particular, I read a few articles on
  [zettelkasten.de](https://zettelkasten.de/) that helped me better understand
  some concepts.
