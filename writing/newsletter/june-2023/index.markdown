This is what I've been up to in June 2023:

* I continued writing about the development of the [balloon shooter
  game](/projects/agdpp/index.html). The actual development is already done,
  and I'm still playing catch up with the articles. Here are the ones that I
  wrote this month:

    * [Does TDD work when building a game?](/writing/agdpp-tdd-and-games/index.html)
    * [Spawn multiple balloons](/writing/agdpp-spawn-multiple-balloons/index.html)
    * [Multiplayer](/writing/agdpp-multiplayer/index.html)

* I had a discussion with [Ron](https://www.ronjeffries.com/) about high-level
  vs micro-tests. I wrote about it in [High-level or micro-tests? A discussion
  with Ron.](/writing/high-level-low-level-ron-reply/index.html)

* I couldn't resist the
  [urge](https://hachyderm.io/@rickardlindberg/110447282439624451) to start
  working on my own video editor software. I will write a blog post (or maybe
  a new series?) about it. In the meantime, the code is on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlvideo). I am really not that
  good at naming my projects. They all start with "rl" plus the general function
  of the software:

  * `rlvideo`: My video editor.
  * [rlmeta](/projects/rlmeta/index.html): My meta compiler.
  * [rliterate](/projects/rliterate/index.html): My literate programming tool.
  * [rlselect](/projects/rlselect/index.html): My interactive line searcher tool.
  * ...

* [Last month](/writing/newsletter/may-2023/index.html) I wrote about that I
  started a new project: animation studio. I have since successfully used it to
  create some animations for a video. Now that I've started working on my own
  video editor, I'm thinking that I want to integrate that functionality into
  the video editor instead of developing it further. We'll see.

* I published one programming video on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):
