This is what I've been up to in March 2024:

* I wanted to learn more about the roots of CI/CD (Continuous
  Integration/Delivery/Deployment).

    * I read the chapter [Continuous Integration](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2/continuous_integration)
      from James Shore's book The Art of Agile Development.

    * I read [Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com/) by Jez Humble and David Farley.

    * I learned from both sources, and I'm eager to start applying those ideas
      to various projects.

* I started reading [Building
  Microservices](https://samnewman.io/books/building_microservices_2nd_edition/)
  by Sam Newman. I wanted to learn what microservices are all about. So far, my
  impression is that it is an exercise in building distributed systems, and
  many projects will be better of by not using it since distributed systems
  come with a cost.

* I studied [Testing Without
  Mocks](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables/testing-without-mocks)
  more. In particular [Output
  Tracking](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables/testing-without-mocks#output-tracking).
  Output Tracking is currently the most difficult aspect for me to know if I
  use correctly. I've previously touched on this subject in [How to test a
  router?](/writing/how-to-test-a-router/index.html) I will probably write
  another blog post to refine my thinking.
