This is what I've been up to in July 2021:

* I cleaned up the rlselect repo and recorded a new demo gif. You can see it at
  the [project page](/projects/rlselect/index.html). I did not improve the
  literate document because I had no incentive to do so. The application does
  what I want it to do, and from a maintenance point of view, I can continue to
  improve it with smart notes literate programming support.  But as long as
  there is nothing I want to improve in the application, I think I will leave
  it like this. I know the application does some trick with stdin/stdout that
  might be interesting to write a blog post about. If I decide to do that, I
  might start by explaining the trick inside the literate document, and then
  write the blog post.

* I felt the urge to work on a Timeline canvas component. That is, only the
  timeline widget in [Timeline](/projects/timeline/index.html). It's been a
  long time since I first started the project, and I would probably do some
  things differently today. An isolated component could also be useful for
  other projects.

* I revisited RLMeta and wanted to work more on it. I have some ideas of what
  to work on next. We will see.

* I decided to skip doing a video version of this update, and probably future
  updates as well. I don't think the updates were a good fit for video. These
  updates are useful for me because I like to go back and get a quick overview
  of what I was doing. A bullet list works perfect for that. A non searchable
  video does not. I might record only demos if I have any and link them in the
  update. We will see. I still enjoy making videos.

* I shot daily vlogs (not published online) during two weeks of my vacation,
  and that is something I enjoyed to do. So I got to practice shooting,
  editing, story telling, etc. I also watched much Casey Neistat and Peter
  Lindgren for inspiration.

* I watched "The Social Dilemma" and though about how I missed when the
  internet was just a bunch of personal homepages not controlled by a few
  companies.
