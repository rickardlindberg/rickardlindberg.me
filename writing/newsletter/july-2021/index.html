      <h1>July 2021 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  3 August 2021.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in July 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I cleaned up the rlselect repo and recorded a new demo gif. You can see it at the <a href="../../../projects/rlselect/">project page</a>. I did not improve the literate document because I had no incentive to do so. The application does what I want it to do, and from a maintenance point of view, I can continue to improve it with smart notes literate programming support. But as long as there is nothing I want to improve in the application, I think I will leave it like this. I know the application does some trick with stdin/stdout that might be interesting to write a blog post about. If I decide to do that, I might start by explaining the trick inside the literate document, and then write the blog post.</p></li>
<li><p>I felt the urge to work on a Timeline canvas component. That is, only the timeline widget in <a href="../../../projects/timeline/">Timeline</a>. It’s been a long time since I first started the project, and I would probably do some things differently today. An isolated component could also be useful for other projects.</p></li>
<li><p>I revisited RLMeta and wanted to work more on it. I have some ideas of what to work on next. We will see.</p></li>
<li><p>I decided to skip doing a video version of this update, and probably future updates as well. I don’t think the updates were a good fit for video. These updates are useful for me because I like to go back and get a quick overview of what I was doing. A bullet list works perfect for that. A non searchable video does not. I might record only demos if I have any and link them in the update. We will see. I still enjoy making videos.</p></li>
<li><p>I shot daily vlogs (not published online) during two weeks of my vacation, and that is something I enjoyed to do. So I got to practice shooting, editing, story telling, etc. I also watched much Casey Neistat and Peter Lindgren for inspiration.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched “The Social Dilemma” and though about how I missed when the internet was just a bunch of personal homepages not controlled by a few companies.</p></li>
</ul>
