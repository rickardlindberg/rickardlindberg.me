This is what I've been up to in July 2019:

* I continued work on the RLMeta VM post.

* I watched [Steal Like An Artist: Austin Kleon at
  TEDxKC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oww7oB9rjgw). Main takeway was that
  every work is a mashup. Steal from others and show your mashup so that we can
  steal from you.

* I reread parts of *The Art of Explanation* by Lee LeFever. He presents a way
  to explain things so that people understand. I will try to be inspired by
  this way when writing.

* I thought about converting all posts on this site to "blog posts" and putting
  them under `rickardlindberg.me/blog/` and using tags for categories. Then
  allowing tags to also have explanations. Not sure if this structure is better
  or not.

* I read parts of *Hackers and Painters* by Paul Graham. A few quotes that I
  liked:

    > Programming languages are what programmers think in. Naturally, this has
    > a big effect on the kind of thoughts they have.

    I fully agree with this, and this is one of the reasons I want to learn
    more about language design so that I can design ideal languages for
    problems.

    > After a certain age, programmers rarely switch languages voluntarily.
    > Whatever language people happen to be used to, they tend to consider just
    > good enough.

    I don't want to get stuck in a language. How can I avoid it?

* I watched [How to Start a Business or Podcast From Scratch | Tim
  Ferriss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymiBDged-eQ). Main takeway was that
  it is easier to create a new category by finding a niche market to fill.
  Filling demand (in a new category) is easier than creating demand (in an
  existing category).

* I started reading *The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing* by Al Ries because it
  was recommended by Tim in the above video. Some quotes:

    > The easy answer is to make sure your programs are in tune with the laws
    > of marketing.

    > There are laws of nature, so why shouldn’t there be laws of marketing?
    > You can build a great-looking airplane, but it’s not going to get off the
    > ground unless it adheres to the laws of physics, especially the law of
    > gravity. You can build an architectural masterpiece on a sand dune, but
    > the first hurricane will undermine your creation. So it follows that you
    > can build a brilliant marketing program only to have one of the immutable
    > laws knock you flat if you don’t know what they are.

* I read about an incremental approach to compiler construction
  [here](http://scheme2006.cs.uchicago.edu/11-ghuloum.pdf),
  [here](https://generalproblem.net/), and
  [here](https://blog.sigplan.org/2019/07/09/my-first-fifteen-compilers/). The
  incremental approach starts with a small language (just integers) and
  builds upon that. At each stage, there is a working compiler. I want to
  explore this approach more. Can such a compiler be written with
  [RLMeta](/tags/rlmeta/index.html)?

* I write articles about RLMeta in a literate programming style. Sometimes I
  think: Why is all this text needed? The code speaks for itself, right?
  Probably it doesn't, but it is interesting to try to find the right balance.

* I read [PEG
  Parsers](https://medium.com/@gvanrossum_83706/peg-parsers-7ed72462f97c) by
  Guido van Rossum. He is experimenting with replacing Python's parser with a
  PEG-version.

* I found [Rascal - Metaprogramming Language](https://www.rascal-mpl.org/). I
  want to read more about it, but here is a good summary:

    > You want to use the best tool for the job when analyzing, transforming or
    > generating source code, so normally you will end up with many different
    > tools, possibly even written in different languages. Now the problem is
    > to integrate these tools again. Rascal solves this problem by integrating
    > source code analysis, transformation, and generation primitives on the
    > language level. Use it for any kind of metaprogramming task: to construct
    > parsers for programming languages, to analyze and transform source code,
    > or to define new DSLs with full IDE support.

* I read [The forgotten software that inspired our modern
  world](http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20190722-the-apple-software-that-inspired-the-internet).
  A quote I liked:

    > But even more than that, HyperCard didn’t compromise between the easily
    > usable and the creatively powerful.

    Something in that reminds me of what Alan Kay said. Something about
    simplifying but not dumbing down when teaching children.

* I read [The Inverted Pyramid of Blogging Income: How Pro Bloggers Make
  Money](https://technicalblogging.com/blogging-income-how-bloggers-make-money/).
  Main takeaway was that if you want to make money blogging, you should convert
  readers into customers and you must therefore also have another product to
  sell.
