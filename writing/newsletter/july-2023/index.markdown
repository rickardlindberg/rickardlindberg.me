This is what I've been up to in July 2023:

* I continued work on my [video editor](/projects/rlvideo/index.html). Here is
  the initial blog post about it: [Writing my own video
  editor](/writing/writing-my-own-video-editor/index.html).

* I started writing [DevLogs](/tags/devlog/index.html). DevLogs is an
  experiment to try to document development that I do on various projects. I
  will try to write what is going on in my head as I do various development
  tasks. So far, they have all been about development of the video editor.

* I wrote a blog post called [How to get fast feedback on graphical
  code?](/writing/fast-feedback-on-graphical-code/index.html) I share a
  technique that I started using while developing the video editor.
