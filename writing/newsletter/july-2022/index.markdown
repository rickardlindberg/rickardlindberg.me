This is what I've been up to in July 2022:

* I continued practicing Agile software development with
  [RLCI](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlci/). I slowly get the feeling
  that Agile is not really what most people think it is. Some things I read and
  watched this month in that vein:

    * A [few](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1546604233323032576)
      [tweets](https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1552432052762320896) by
      Allen Holub and a [conversation](https://youtu.be/hxXmTnb3mFU) he had
      with Dave Farley gave me some insights into what "real" Agile is about.

    * [Phrases in computing that might need
      retiring](https://www.sicpers.info/2022/07/phrases-in-computing-that-might-need-retiring/)
      by Graham Lee indicated to me that the term "Agile" has changed meaning
      over the years.

    * [Gotta Be
      Good](https://www.ronjeffries.com/articles/-z022/0222ff/gotta-be-good/)
      by Ron Reffries indicated to me that "real" Agile is actually HARD and
      need to be practiced to get good at.

* I published another five programming videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):

  * [How to write tests that allow refactoring your code?](https://youtu.be/d7fq8JyU9jg)
  * [Deploying my continuous integration software to a server.](https://youtu.be/BmUz4my7eko)
  * [Therapeutic refactoring and polishing of a feature.](https://youtu.be/C05OD7h0-gg)
  * [How to incorporate evolutionary design into the development process?](https://youtu.be/h_oRLiJo3Tc)
  * [I made a mistake when evolving the design of RLCI to support a database.](https://youtu.be/WlvsjCeuT6w)
