This is what I've been up to in January 2023:

* I started working on my [ideal code hosting
  platform](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/projects). I've attempted to do
  this once before and failed. I got the urge to give it another try. With my
  new experience of working in an agile way, I think my chance of succeeding
  this time is higher. But as always, you need to keep working on the project
  if it's not going to die. Anyway, I am happy with the experience of trying
  and will for sure learn something.

* I watched [AgileByExample 2021: J.B. Rainsberger - Unlocking the Awesome
  Power of Refactoring](https://youtu.be/yXrY5pT88vA). I learned about the idea
  of practice. If something you do regularly requires conscious brain effort,
  practice it until it becomes boring. That frees up brain capacity to think
  about more high-level problems.

* I started reading *Extreme Programming Explained* (Second Edition) by Kent
  Beck. I wanted to learn more about XP since it seems to be the origin of
  "real" agile. I wanted to learn more about how accurate [this
  tweet](https://twitter.com/christianhujer/status/1614888741126176771) was:

  > • DevOps is just whole team+CI from XP.<br>
  > • Teaming is whole team+pair programming from XP.<br>
  > • TBD is just CI from XP.<br>
  > • BDD is TDD+ATDD from XP.<br>
  ><br>
  > ⇒ 20+ years later, XP is still leading the way.

* I made some progress on my thinking about continuous integration and have a
  post about it in progress titled [What should a Continuous Integration (CI)
  server do?](/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html)

* I published another two programming videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):

    * [My experience of one year on Youtube.](https://youtu.be/Hdg0LNga2dQ)
    * [How I start a new programming project. Building my ideal code hosting platform.](https://youtu.be/ZvowW_toPmQ)
