This is what I've been up to in June 2019:

* I was inspired to try writing a journal after stumbling across Derek Siver's
  blog post [Benefits of a daily diary and topic
  journals](https://sivers.org/dj). The idea is to write for my future self to
  help me solve problems by recording my thoughts and reflecting on them.

* I read *Poke the Box* by Seth Godin. My main takeaway was that **initiative
  is scarce**, and if you take initiative, you are valuable.

* I read [Writing A Compiler In Go](https://compilerbook.com/) by Thorsten
  Ball. It is a topic that interests me. I learned about designing virtual
  machines.

* I learned a technique for parsing offside rule languages with PEG parsers via
  [A PEG Markdown parser](https://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown/). I plan to
  write a blog post about this technique.

* I read *Show Your Work!* by Austin Kleon. Some takeaways:

    * An amateur is sometimes better at explaining something than an expert
      because the amateur has recently encountered it and knows what is hard.
      An expert has forgotten. Therefore **blogging about problems and
      solutions when I encounter them is useful**.

    * It is useful to share the process of creating something, not just the
      finished work.

    * It inspired me to publish draft posts on this blog.

    * It inspired me to write these monthly newsletters.

* I finished writing [Optimizing
  RLMeta](/writing/optimizing-rlmeta/index.html). I struggled with grammar and
  usage (should I use past or present, active or passive, we or I, and so on).
  I read other articles to try to analyze what they did. But I also came to one
  important realization: if I find it hard to write, I can read what I've
  written, find something small to fix, and then I'm suddenly writing again. I
  will keep writing and hopefully keep improving.

* I have tried to get into the habit of writing a bit at least every day. Even
  though some days I produced almost nothing, I kept doing it. Eventually it
  payed off, but sometimes I felt like I needed a longer session to get
  something useful done. Often times, short sessions worked as well. One thing
  that helped me continue was to take a note at the end of a session what to
  proceed with.

* I read parts of [Beautiful Racket](https://beautifulracket.com/). Racket is a
  programming language designed for language-oriented programming. I have for a
  long time felt that this is a better way to program, but never fully put it
  into practice. I even started writing [a book](https://leanpub.com/ldd) about
  it. I intend to continue pursuing this way of programming with the help of
  [RLMeta](/tags/rlmeta/index.html). I will most likely return to *Beautiful
  Racket*.

* I read *4-Hour Work Week* by Timothy Ferris. Some takeaways:

    * Unrealistic goals as easier to achieve because the competition is not as
      fierce.

    * 80/20 rule. I can stop doing 80% of what I'm doing and still perform as
      well.

    * Batching work is sometimes more effective. Limit Twitter/Email/etc to
      once/twice a day to not be bothered with it the rest of the time.

    * If I did not have to work for money, what would I do? If this is the last
      day of my life, would I do what I'm doing?

* I watched [(sixth RacketCon): Matthew Butterick -- The Making of “Beautiful
  Racket”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_ptYjf8Bes). My main takeaway was
  that a DSL has two parts: the domain and the programming language. And the
  most important part is the domain. In order to create a good DLS you need to
  have much knowledge about the domain.

* I watched [Arnold Schwarzenegger 2019 - The speech that broke the internet -
  Motivational & Inspiring](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWJVvNptHZ4). In it
  he says that you should work hard and advertise. This felt similar to
  Austin Kleon's advice that you should show your work.

* I watched [Typography for Docs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8J6HuvosP0s).
  This is also by Matthew Butterick. I like this talk as well. It inspired me
  to try to improve typography on my blog. We'll see if I get around to it.

* I read [Uniform Structured Syntax, Metaprogramming and Run-time
  Compilation](https://m00natic.github.io/lisp/manual-jit.html). My main
  takeaway was that compilation happens at runtime. Just in time. Therefore
  the compiler must be shipped with the runtime. Common Lisp has hooks for
  different times during compilation: reader macro, macro, etc.

* I watched [Steady Typing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viF1bVTOO6k). It
  shows a projectional editor. Those interest me. They are one inspiration for
  [RLiterate](/projects/rliterate/index.html).
