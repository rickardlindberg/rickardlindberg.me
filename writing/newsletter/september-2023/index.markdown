This is what I've been up to in September 2023:

* I wrote another devlog about my [Raspberry Pi game
  console](/writing/devlog-013-raspberrypi-game-console/index.html).

* I watched [Continued Learning: The Beauty of Maintenance - Kent Beck - DDD
  Europe 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gib0hKYjB0). What stuck in my
  mind was the metaphor that software development is like a swan. You can watch
  the beauty as it moves across the water. That represents the behavior of the
  software system. The features. But to make that happen, lots of things is
  going on under the surface that you don't see. The swan paddles its feet (?)
  to go forward, poop comes out, it is messy. That is the structural changes
  needed in software to make the features possible. Refactoring.

* I started reading [Modern Software
  Engineering](https://www.davefarley.net/?p=352) by Dave Farley. So far, I've
  gotten a few useful ideas out of it.

* When I started reading about software engineering, [Alan
  Kay](/writing/alan-kay-notes/index.html) came to mind
  again. I revisited some of his talks, trying to find things about science and
  engineering in particular. I admire Alan's work, and I also like the Agile
  concepts that Dave talks about. I'm interested in figuring out if they
  contradict, or if I can happily continue to admire both.

* When reading about Alan Kay again, Bret Victor came to mind, and I watched
  his talk [The Humane Representation of
  Thought](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agOdP2Bmieg).  I feel like his and
  Kay's work are worth revisiting from time to time. For inspiration for better
  ways of doing things. And for inspiration of things to try to do differently.
