This is what I've been up to in March 2022:

* I started prototyping [RLCI](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlci/) which
  is an experimental CI/CD system designed to solve problems I've had with
  Jenkins. I made some videos about it too.

* I published another four programming videos on my Youtube channel:

    * [Sharing thoughts about a new CI system that solves problems I've had with Jenkins.](https://youtu.be/pZwjYknDxYo)
    * [Thinking about representations for CI pipelines.](https://youtu.be/-iSgZkqlUVw)
    * [Demoing prototype of CI/CD system.](https://youtu.be/oPX8bBTNBMI)
    * [How can a worker node execute code on behalf of a CI/CD server?](https://youtu.be/RHy-oryo5rI)
