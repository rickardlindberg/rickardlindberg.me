This is what I've been up to in January 2022:

* I did more writing on the [RLMeta](/writing/rlmeta-poster2/index.html) blog
  post. I took some larger time blocks to work on it, and I can now finally see
  it being finished next month.

* I decided to set up a [repo on
  GitHub](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlmeta) for RLMeta where it can
  continue to be improved. I plan for it to contain the base version of RLMeta
  which is the minimal version that is able to compile itself and maintain
  properties such as flexible, easy to extend, and easy to understand. Then I
  want to include examples as well to show how RLMeta can be used and how you
  can extend it in various ways.

* I started publishing weekly programming videos on Youtube. My goal for 2022
  is to make one programming related video each week. I'm currently in the
  process of finding a good format or formats, and I am experimenting a lot.
  This month I made the following videos:

    * [I'm starting weekly programming videos on Youtube.](https://youtu.be/NsVERD6Xvvw)
    * [How a Python programmer extracts timelapses from camera SD card.](https://youtu.be/6lqdJvSuZpk)
    * [Writing a decoder for the "Quite OK Image Format" (QOI) in 55 lines of RLMeta.](https://youtu.be/aT2XbyMv53E)
    * [Rewriting QOI decoder semantic action in Python for clarity and speed.](https://youtu.be/V3oUnhyCSkY)

* I got an urge to write a projectional editor to learn more about projectional
  editing. It's something I've been thinking about before and have tried to
  incorporate a bit in [RLiterate](/projects/rliterate/index.html).

* I watched [A Tour of the Acme Editor](https://youtu.be/dP1xVpMPn8M) by Russ
  Cox. Acme felt like a different and unique text editor with an interesting
  approach.

* I did some work to update my
  [dotfiles](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/dotfiles/). Mainly to simplify
  and add support for different setups. When I am recording videos for Youtube,
  for example, I want to have bigger font size in various applications. With my
  new dotfiles, I can now quickly switch between different setups.
