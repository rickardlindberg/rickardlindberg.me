This is what I've been up to in October 2021:

* I set up some infrastructure for writing the blog post about
  [RLMeta](/writing/rlmeta-poster-2/index.html). Now I can automatically
  generate the post with up to date code examples and syntax highlighting.  I
  didn't make much progress on the writing itself. Hopefully I can make more
  progress on that in November.

* I got an email from a person that was interested in old project of mine:
  [frp-arduino](https://github.com/frp-arduino/frp-arduino). It was nice to see
  that something I've put into the world sparked an interest in someone else.

* I read a
  [tweet](https://twitter.com/seanmcdirmid18/status/1448500893331058692) by
  Sean McDirmid about incremental parsing. I asked him if his approach was
  similar to the one used in
  [Ohm](https://ohmlang.github.io/pubs/sle2017/incremental-packrat-parsing.pdf)
  (a paper which he also reviewed), but it was different. The approach used in
  Ohm could probably be more easily implemented in RLMeta.

* Besides programming I spend much time learning more about cameras and
  videography. This homepage is mostly dedicated to my interest for
  programming, so I'm not sure how much I want to write about camera related
  stuff.
