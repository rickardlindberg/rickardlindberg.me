This is what I've been up to in April 2021:

* I published 3 new videos where I hack on Smart Notes:

    * [Smart Notes Hacking Session #10: End-To-End Test Framework Embryo](https://youtu.be/v0a904NB7Sc)
    * [Smart Notes Hacking Session #11: Test Clean Up](https://youtu.be/nIfk5zxGyB0)
    * [Smart Notes Hacking Session #12: Search Bar End-To-End Test](https://youtu.be/ryBlkGUJBz8)

* I recorded many more sessions that I have not yet published. So I am a bit
  behind on the editing process.

* I thought about different formats for the hacking sessions. Currently I do a
  bit of preparation off camera, then record one session, then repeat. So all
  changes to Smart Notes are recorded, but not my whole thinking process.  I
  though about still doing the same recordings but editing them into more
  polished videos that might cover one topic or feature instead of just being
  time boxed. I think the verbatim hacking sessions might be more appropriate
  for live streams. I don't know. If you have any feedback on this, please let
  me know.

* I researched and ordered a camera (Sony A6400) and a microphone (Rode
  VideoMic NTG) so that I can hopefully produce videos of higher quality. I
  will experiment with it in the next month.

* I watched [Interview with JT: Andreas Kling of
  SerenityOS](https://youtu.be/5h8bo9OxCwI). One interesting idea that I got
  from the interview was that open source projects might benefit from providing
  source code only, and no binary packages.  Some people might not use the
  software at all then, but the ones that do are more likely to contribute
  changes because the friction to do so is much less once you have build from
  source.
