This is what I've been up to in December 2022:

* I finished writing my blog post [How should I evolve the design of my
  projectional
  editor?](/writing/evolving-design-of-projectional-editor/index.html)

* I studied [Testing Without Mocks: A Pattern
  Language](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks)
  a bit more as James published a draft update of his article. I also watched
  some episodes of [Nullables & A-Frame Architecture
  Livestream](https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables-livestream).

* I got the urge to build a new home for
  [Timeline](/projects/timeline/index.html). Many years ago a
  [wrote](/writing/new-home-for-timeline/index.html) about what I want from a
  new home. I have tried building it once before but failed. Now with my
  updated knowledge of Agile development, I think I might be able to pull it
  off. (But most likely I will fail again. If I try.)

* I solved Advent of Code [day 17](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17) and
  published my
  [solution](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/aoc/blob/main/2022/17.py) on
  Github.

* I published another two programming videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):

    * [This refactoring uncovered another problem.](https://youtu.be/PG3XvSd7Mns)
    * [How blogging helped me solve a programming problem.](https://youtu.be/AuuLTUSfBjs)
