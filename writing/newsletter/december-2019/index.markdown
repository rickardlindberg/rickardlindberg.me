This is what I've been up to in December 2019:

* I read [WebAssembly: How and
  why](https://blog.logrocket.com/webassembly-how-and-why-559b7f96cd71/) and
  watched [Rust, WebAssembly, and the future of Serverless by Steve
  Klabnik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMB6AlE1QuI).
  WebAssembly might be an interesting compilation target to experiment with.

* I read [Toward a Galvanizing Definition of Technical
  Debt](https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/toward-a-galvanizing-definition-of-technical-debt).
  I found his definition of technical debt useful.

* I watched ["Performance Matters" by Emery
  Berger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-TLSBdHe1A&feature=emb_logo). Low
  level details are interesting some times.

* I read [Reviewing Pull
  Requests](https://chelseatroy.com/2019/12/18/reviewing-pull-requests/). I
  like the idea that more work is put on the reviewer and that the reviewer can
  also push fixes to the pull request. It reminds me of the [C4
  process](https://rfc.unprotocols.org/spec:1/C4/) where every patch is almost
  always immediately accepted. If anyone has comments on it, it is solved by
  creating another patch.

* I read [It's time to start
  writing](https://alexnixon.github.io/2019/12/10/writing.html). It inspired me
  to write more to think more clearly.

* I read [Typing with pleasure](https://pavelfatin.com/typing-with-pleasure/)
  and also watched the linked video [Applied Sciences Group: High Performance
  Touch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOvQCPLkPt4). This topic is relevant
  for RLiterate.
