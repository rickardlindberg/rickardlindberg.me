This is what I've been up to in May 2020:

* I created a [poster](/pages/rlmeta-poster/index.html) showcasing RLMeta and
  [wrote](/writing/creating-rlmeta-poster/index.html) about it in a blog post.
  I am happy that I was able to improve both clarity and speed of RLMeta.

* I started working on a [second version](/writing/rlmeta-poster2/index.html)
  of the RLMeta poster. So far I've been able to resolve some of the issue from
  the first version (generate labels in actions, remove dependency on Bash) as
  well as other improvements.

* Back in 2012 I
  [wrote](/writing/reflections-on-programming/2012-08-30-learn-how-to-implement-languages/index.html)
  that it might be interesting to learn about techniques for creating
  programming languages. With RLMeta I have studied some of the suggested
  topics. It only took me like 8 years, but I'm happy to have finally done it.

* I read [Baby's First Garbage
  Collector](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/12/08/babys-first-garbage-collector/).
  After reading it I had the feeling that I could easily implement a garbage
  collector myself. I haven't done it, but when I do, I will refer back to this
  blog post.
