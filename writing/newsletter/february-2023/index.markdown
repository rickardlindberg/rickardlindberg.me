This is what I've been up to in February 2023:

* I started reading [Joy of Agility](https://joyofagility.com/). It has many
  interesting stories that provide valuable lessons.

* I continued writing my blog post [What should a Continuous
  Integration (CI) server do?](/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html).
  I also asked for feedback on [James'](https://www.jamesshore.com/) Discord
  server and got many useful responses. In particular i learned about
  [pre-tested integration](https://www.eficode.com/blog/pre-tested-integration)
  which looks very similar to what I tried to describe. I will update my blog
  post with feedback, and then I will call it done.

* I [asked Allen
  Holub](https://hachyderm.io/@rickardlindberg/109846707922919650) how to think
  about work that is not a story. Agile is about constantly providing value via
  stories, but what about work that needs to be done that doesn't fit that
  category?

* I read [PostScript: A Digital Printing
  Press](https://computerhistory.org/blog/postscript-a-digital-printing-press/).
  It was a bit of computer history that I enjoyed.

* I published another two programming videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):

    * [What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?](https://youtu.be/2VrKIIMTFUI)
    * [How TDD helps me solve programming problems.](https://youtu.be/_uB1KGPjJjw)
