This is what I've been up to in November 2020:

* I continued work on the prototype of the note taking application.

    * I added navigation support and worked on the animations:

    * I added basic editing capabilities via an external editor. Now you can
      add a new note, add a new child note, and edit an existing note. Basic
      editing capabilities left to implement is linking two arbitrary notes and
      deleting links.

    * In addition to visual aspects, I also fleshed out the data model so that
      notes are read and written to file.

* I read [Why I Still Use
  Vim](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/why-i-still-use-vim/). The
  point being made is that that development tools must be easily customizable.
