This is what I've been up to in April 2020:

* I finished the blog post about [Layout/Update problem in
  wxPython](/writing/wx-layout-update/index.html).

* I read [Crafting "Crafting
  Interpreters"](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2020/04/05/crafting-crafting-interpreters/).
  It was fun to read about his process of writing the book.

* I watched [LEADERSHIP LAB: The Craft of Writing
  Effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM&t=1843s). Main
  takeaway was that the most important thing about writing is that it should be
  **valuable** to the reader. Everything else is secondary. A good structure to
  make it valuable is to first describe a problem (that the reader has) and
  then a solution.

* I watched [(ninth RacketCon): Andrew Blinn â€“ Fructure: A Structured Editing
  Engine in Racket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnbVCNIh1NA). It inspired
  me.
