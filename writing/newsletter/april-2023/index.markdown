This is what I've been up to in April 2023:

* I finished writing the blog post [What should a Continuous Integration (CI)
  server do?](/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html)

* I started working on a game and am documenting the journey in a series called
  [Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame](/projects/agdpp/index.html).
  This month I wrote 6 blog posts with 4 accompanying videos. It has been a lot
  of fun. Right now I've spend a little more time programming and a little less
  time writing, so I have some catch up to do.

* I read a bit and thought a bit about the agile concept of a (user) story. I
  plan to clarify my thinking about stories by writing a blog post about it.

* I watched [Ron Jeffries and Chet Hendrickson Live from Agile2017 -
  LeadingAgile Soundnotes](https://youtu.be/UwYbSBUrotU). The part that was
  most interesting to me (and my research about stories) was the idea that not
  everything the team does is on the backlog. Only stuff the PO cares about is
  on the backlog.

* I spent some time reading articles on [Ron's
  site](https://www.ronjeffries.com/). One favourite is [Gotta Be
  Good](https://www.ronjeffries.com/articles/-z022/0222ff/gotta-be-good/). Ron
  is also working on a game in Python which I tried and
  [wrote](/writing/trying-rons-python-asteroids/index.html) about. His writing
  about his game development partly inspired me to do a similar series about my
  game.

* I published another four programming videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):
