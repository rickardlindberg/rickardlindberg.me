This is what I've been up to in December 2021:

* I did more writing on the [RLMeta](/writing/rlmeta-poster-2/index.html) blog
  post. I wrote for quite many days, but not for a very long time each day. I
  believe consistency works better.  After each small edit, I published the
  draft. I will continue writing in January.

* After quite a long absence, I made a contribution to
  [Timeline](/projects/timeline/index.html) again. The contribution was to
  replace all image export dialogs with a better, more flexible one. I got
  inspired to work on this because of a problem that a user expressed on the
  mailing list. The new dialog will hopefully make the user experience a bit
  better and it simplified the code base. After the initial version, I had to
  make tweaks to make it work good on both Linux and Windows. Even though
  wxPython is cross-platform, you can still run into issues that are platform
  specific.

* I started planning and recording a series of programming videos that I will
  publish on Youtube. My goal for 2022 is to publish one video every week.
  More on that in the first video, which I have planned for 7th of January.

* I watched [Building an encoder for the "Quite OK Image Format"
  (QOI)](https://youtu.be/GgsRQuGSrc0). It inspired me to try and write a QOI
  decoder in RLMeta. I plan to make a video about that.
