This is what I've been up to in November 2023:

* I continued work on my [experimental programming
  language](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/linda-meta-oop) which is based
  on [RLMeta](/writing/rlmeta/index.html).

    * I did more research on the paradigm of the
      [Linda programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_(coordination_language))
      and how it would fit together with RLMeta.

    * I started evolving the RLMeta implementation to support the paradigm of
      Linda. I realized that RLMeta could itself be implemented in this
      paradigm and started to evolve the code base in that direction.

    * I plan on solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles
      using this language to see how problems from different domains can be
      expressed.

    * I really should document this language and my work on it better.
