<p><em>Published on  2 February 2021.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in January 2021:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I posted a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh2bik1cOl0">video</a> demoing my note taking application. I have a few ideas of things I would like to improve in it. I’m thinking about recording some hacking sessions and publishing them. Let me know if you would be interested in that.</p></li>
<li><p>I created a simple HTML file upload form to learn more how file transfer over HTTP works. I have an idea for a different kind of CI system that I would like to try and implement. It is a big project and I’ve not committed to anything, so it will likely not happen anytime soon. But I’ve had the idea for a while and felt the urge multiple times to attempt to implement it. Anyway, file transfer over HTTP might be one part of that system.</p></li>
<li><p>I read parts of Clean Code again. Readability is important, but when reading the examples, I couldn’t help to think that no matter how clean we write our code, it would benefit from a description in prose as well. I’m thinking about Literate Programming. Why has it not caught on? Why is nobody using it? I might want to research this topic a bit. I have some practical experience with LP through RLiterate. Perhaps RLiterate can solve some problems with LP. At least it can be a playground for trying out new ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued work on the <a href="../../../writing/kinesis-advantage-2-swedish-setup/">blog post</a> about the configuration of my Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard.</p></li>
</ul>
