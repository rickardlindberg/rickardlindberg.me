This is what I've been up to in January 2021:

* I posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh2bik1cOl0) demoing my
  note taking application. I have a few ideas of things I would like to improve
  in it. I'm thinking about recording some hacking sessions and publishing
  them. Let me know if you would be interested in that.

* I created a simple HTML file upload form to learn more how file transfer over
  HTTP works. I have an idea for a different kind of CI system that I would
  like to try and implement. It is a big project and I've not committed to
  anything, so it will likely not happen anytime soon. But I've had the idea
  for a while and felt the urge multiple times to attempt to implement it.
  Anyway, file transfer over HTTP might be one part of that system.

* I read parts of Clean Code again. Readability is important, but when reading
  the examples, I couldn't help to think that no matter how clean we write our
  code, it would benefit from a description in prose as well. I'm thinking
  about Literate Programming. Why has it not caught on? Why is nobody using it?
  I might want to research this topic a bit. I have some practical experience
  with LP through RLiterate. Perhaps RLiterate can solve some problems with LP.
  At least it can be a playground for trying out new ideas.

* I continued work on the [blog
  post](/writing/kinesis-advantage-2-swedish-setup/index.html) about the configuration
  of my Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard.
