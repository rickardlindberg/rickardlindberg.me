<p><em>Published on  2 November 2019.</em></p>

<p>This is what Iâ€™ve been up to in October 2019:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I read <a href="http://users.ece.cmu.edu/~koopman/stack_computers/">Stack Computers: the new wave</a> by Philip J. Koopman, Jr. I did not dig into details about the different computers, but the rest of the book gave me a good understanding stack computers.</p></li>
<li><p>I thought about how stack computers could support programming language features. In particular, I though about how they could support local variables. A calling convention could be used where function parameters are always put on the stack. If a function wants to, it can store those in a frame for later reference. But it does not have to. The compiler might also optimize away local variables in favor of pure stack operations.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued working on <a href="../../../writing/expr-to-x86-compiler/">compiling expressions to x86 machine code</a>. I did debugging with gdb and learned some useful commands. I managed to compile a subset of expressions down to x86 machine code. It was satisfying. I was helped by <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/adventures-in-jit-compilation-part-4-in-python/">Adventures in JIT compilation: Part 4 - in Python</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I got an urge to do a rewrite of <a href="../../../projects/rliterate/">RLiterate</a> to improve performance and fix bugs that make it annoying to use. I use RLiterate to write articles for my blog. I really like the features of it, but the poor performance makes it annoying to use. I had though of a slightly different architecture that would mitigate those problems. But it would require a complete rewrite. I have now successfully validated that the new architecture works better and I will continue to build the next version. You can see it <a href="../../../projects/rliterate/book2/">here</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I worked on RLiterate in small chunks. First I did some work and published that version on my homepage. Then at a later time I did review of what I had done. Then I went through and fixed comments from review. This workflow has worked quite well. Having time between the two activities has allowed me to rest and reflect.</p></li>
<li><p>Because I got distracted with RLiterate, I did not make progress on the article about <a href="../../../writing/rlmeta-memoize-failures/">memoizing failures in RLMeta</a> that I said I would hoped have finished by now. I have not abandoned my drafts though. Something more interesting got in between. I will get back to writing at some point.</p></li>
</ul>
