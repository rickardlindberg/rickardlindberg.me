This is what I've been up to in May 2021:

* I published a new video where I hack on Smart Notes: [Smart Notes Hacking
  Session #13: Improve Search Bar Test](https://youtu.be/95l_XFtx-JQ).

* A consequence of trying to record hacking videos was that I ended up not
  doing any programming because I felt the barrier was too big. I felt pressure
  to record interesting sessions so instead I put it off and did no programming
  at all.

* I still think video is an interesting format. So instead of more hacking
  sessions, this month, I tried to make a video version of this update where I
  also show what I've been working on. Let me know what you think.

* I actually did program on Smart Notes, and the first version of the table
  view is now working. ([Demo at 1:08](https://youtu.be/cMqtkyMyr-w?t=68))

* I had a few ideas for new features for Smart Notes:

    * The possibility to pin notes so that they are easily accessible and
      linkable when navigating to other notes. ([Explanation at
      3:26](https://youtu.be/cMqtkyMyr-w?t=206))

    * The possibility to go to a random note for leisure browsing. It might
      remind you of interesting things that you wouldn't have otherwise
      looked at.

    * Add support for some kind of literate programming. I read
      ([here](https://twitter.com/mpeytonjones/status/1379500747751092226),
      [here](https://twitter.com/khinsen/status/1379762605837983746), and
      [here](https://twitter.com/rob_rix/status/1379593489344819204)) about the
      idea that literate programming has focused more on a pedagogical
      presentation order and that that style is in conflict with what
      maintainers of software need.  So I am thinking along the lines of having
      Smart Notes annotate code in some way.  The focus should not be on a
      linear presentation style (as in
      [RLiterate](/projects/rliterate/index.html)) that has to be carefully
      maintaned, but rather on annotating code and making useful connections.
      Imagine that every unit of a code base (function, class, etc) is
      represented as a note, and that there are links between notes to
      represent execution paths or related code. When working on a specific
      problem, you can gather the notes (parts of the code) that needs changing
      and you have all in one place. Another crucial feature to support
      maintainers (and working with others) is that it should be possible to
      edit code "as usual" without the need to use a literate programming tool.

* I learned more about video editing.

    * I bought a new camera, a Sony A6400 with a Sigma lens, that I've been
      playing around with.

    * I learned about concepts such as exposure, shadows, midtones, highlights,
      RGB parade, white balance, and color correction through

    * I switched video editor to [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) from
      [Shotcut](https://shotcut.org/) that I was using before. Compared to
      Shotcut, it feels more professional and intuitive for me to use.
