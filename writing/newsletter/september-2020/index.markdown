This is what I've been up to in September 2020:

* I upgraded the configuration for my Kinesis Advantage 2 keyboard. I am
  planning on writing a [blog
  post](/writing/kinesis-advantage-2-swedish-setup/index.html) about it.

* I read [Back when software was a
  craft](https://jessitron.com/2020/08/04/back-when-software-was-a-craft/). I
  feel that is true, and I miss the craft a bit. I can continue to craft in my
  spare time though.

* I read the book [How to Take Smart Notes](https://takesmartnotes.com/) by
  SÃ¶nke Ahrens. I found it very interesting and I am inspired to take better
  notes.

* I read about [Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) since
  smart notes reminded me of it. Some ideas feel a bit similar.

* I started prototyping a note taking application that follows some principles
  from the book. Here is a screenshot:

* I made no progress on RLiterate 2 this month.
