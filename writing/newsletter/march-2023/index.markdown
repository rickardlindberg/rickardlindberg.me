This is what I've been up to in March 2023:

* I got interested in building a game using [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org).
  I've started playing computer games with my son, so I thought it would be a
  fun challenge to see if I can build a game that we both enjoy playing. I
  think this will be my next side project.

* I watched [Kent Beck On The FIRST Testing Frameworks, TDD, Waterfall & MORE |
  The Engineering Room Ep. 16](https://youtu.be/guycIP56YeY). Listening to Kent
  Beck is always interesting since many of the practices in the software world
  come from him.

* I published no programming videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA). But I
  suspect upcoming ones will be about agile game development.
