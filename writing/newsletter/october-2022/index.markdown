This is what I've been up to in October 2022:

* I started exploring projectional editing with
  [rlproject](https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlproject). For now, I'm
  trying to implement something like what
  [ProjecturEd](https://github.com/projectured/projectured/wiki) describes in
  its documentation to learn how that might work.

* I watched ["Stop Writing Dead Programs" by Jack Rusher (Strange Loop
  2022)](https://youtu.be/8Ab3ArE8W3s). It showed what a better development
  environment might look like. It also showed that a projectional editor might
  make your program feel more alive than a plain text editor. Hillel Wayne
  [points out](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/strangeloop-22/) that the talk
  has factual errors. Nevertheless, I found it inspiring.

* I watched [End to end functional tests that can run in milliseconds | Nat
  Pryce | CukenFest London 2017](https://youtu.be/Fk4rCn4YLLU). Nat showed an
  interesting approach to testing you application in a flexible way.

* I watched [Pairin' with Aaron: Messing with Language
  Servers](https://youtu.be/9fJntxnH4wY). I learned about languages servers
  (LPS's) and their integration with the development environment.

* I watched some episodes of the [Mob Mentality
  Show](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgt1lVMrdwlZKBaerxxp2iQ) and found
  them interesting.

* I published another four programming videos on my [Youtube
  channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA):

  * [Writing and testing a tiny application without mocks.](https://youtu.be/DowzqlHr67k)
  * [I demo a tool that makes me super quick at the command line and more.](https://youtu.be/3060LO0PZaY)
  * [How to check balanced string TDD style + a bonus.](https://youtu.be/1_LAeMUdbH0)
  * [Demo of new project that explores projectional, structured editing.](https://youtu.be/GUX3DQjVg4c)
