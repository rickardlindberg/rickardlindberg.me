This is what I've been up to in December 2020:

* I continued work on the note taking application.

    * I added the remaining editing capabilities and also added a search
      feature so that any note could be found and opened. I am particularly
      happy with how the linking feature turned out. The application is now
      feature complete to the point where it is usable for me. I plan to do a
      video demo of it, so stay tuned for that.

    * I figured out how to properly use pygame and Pycairo together. I was
      mislead by the example in the Pycairo documentation, but eventually
      figured out how to do it for my particular use case. I might write about
      it in a blog post. Let me know if you would be interested in that.

* I discovered [Andreas Kling's
  videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ts8coMP645hZw9JSD3pqQ) where he
  hacks on his SerenityOS operating system. I have only watched a few, but I
  find them quite interesting.
