This is what I've been up to in August 2020:

* I read about
  [Dango](https://www.notion.so/Dango-b46c07f3dc224f968c768885abe70e70). It is
  an example of a universal document type. It interested me because it seems
  related to ideas explored by [VPRI](http://vpri.org/).

* I blogged about the key takeaway that I got from reading [The Bullet Journal
  Method](/writing/bullet-journal-method-migration-as-review/index.html).

* I watched various videos by [Matt
  Ragland](https://www.youtube.com/MattRagland) about journaling. He has been
  an inspiration to me in my bullet journal journey.

* I continued with [RLiterate 2](/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html):

    * I worked on adding toolbar actions for text editing:

    * I implemented splitting and joining a paragraphs with `Enter` and `Del`:

* I migrated my personal email from Gmail to
  [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com). The migration process was easy and so
  far I'm quite happy with my new email client.
