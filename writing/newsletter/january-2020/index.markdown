This is what I've been up to in January 2020:

* I finished the article about [memoizing failures in
  RLMeta](/writing/rlmeta-memoize-failures/index.html).

* I came across [A Compiler Writing
  Journey](https://github.com/DoctorWkt/acwj). It inspired me to write articles
  that explain things that I'm interested in.

* I watched [“Hello, world” from scratch on a 6502 — Part
  1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU). Low level hardware is fun.

* I continued with [RLiterate](/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html) and made
  great
  [progress](/projects/rliterate/book2/index.html#bdeda63252d440c3b3394c34671a9107).
  I'm now confident that the new architecture will work. Now it's just a matter
  of fleshing out the rest of the application until it can edit itself.

* I watched [Sean McDirmid - The Future of Programming will be Live - Curry
  On](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnqkglrSqrg&t=2281s). It made me think
  about introducing "Live examples" in RLiterate. If I have a function I
  want to add an example paragraph that executes that function and be able to
  modify its parameters interactively. Sort of like an interactive test case to
  explore input/output.

* I read about [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
  [here](https://github.com/pshrmn/notes/blob/master/redux/redux.md) and
  [here](https://randycoulman.com/blog/2016/11/22/taking-advantage-of-combinereducers/).
  Its architecture can be an inspiration for how to handle state in RLiterate.
