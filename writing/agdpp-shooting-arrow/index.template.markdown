In this episode we continue to add features to the balloon shooter. It's time
to shoot the arrow!

## Reacp

We are trying to create an absolute minimum version of a balloon shooter game
that we can show to our customer and ask if that was what he had in mind. Our
idea for minimal is this:

* 1 balloon falling down the screen
* 1 arrow pointing in a fixed direction
* 1 button to shoot that single arrow
* Then game over

In the
[previous](/writing/agdpp-demo-and-game-idea/index.html) episode, we took the
first step by drawing a balloon and an arrow. Here is what it looks like:

And a list of possible stories to work on next:

* Balloon moves downwards
* **Arrow animates when shot**
* Arrow can hit balloon
* Point is given for hit
* Game over when miss
* Real graphics instead of circles

I sometimes find it hard to look too far into the future. Perhaps that is true
for our customer as well. I find it much easier to look at the current state
and ask myself "What to work on next?"

When I run the game now, all I want to do is fire that arrow and see it flying
across the screen. So that is our next story!

## Summary

See you in the next episode!
