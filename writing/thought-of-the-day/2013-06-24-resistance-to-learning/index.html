        <h1>Resistance to learning</h1>
<p>Today’s thought is about resistance to learning.</p>
<p>I feel like there is often a resistance to learning and using new languages and technologies. Some arguments of resistance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If we implement this thing in this new language, everyone has to learn that new language, and that will take to much time. It will not be worth it.</p></li>
<li><p>Adding another language to our code base increases the complexity. Having everything in one language is better.</p></li>
<li><p>Our customer demands that we write in a specific language.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What if we could allow experimentation? How can we know if using a new language or technology will be worth it or not? If the only problem turns out to be that people resist learning new things, can’t we solve that problem instead? Maybe keeping the number of languages down to a minimum is better, but why is it better?</p>
