        <h1>Learning about a problem</h1>
<p>Today’s thought is about how we learn to solve problems.</p>
<p>When we do code katas, we solve the same problem over and over again. We might focus on practicing a particular aspect, but we still come up with a solution to the same problem. After doing a code kata multiple times, we have probably tried a few different solutions and come up with one that is our favourite.</p>
<p>Solving the same problem over and over again seems to be one way to find a solution that we are happy about.</p>
<p>The question is if we can apply this problem solving strategy to production code. When we are faced with a programming problem, what if we tried to solve it a couple of times in different ways, evaluate the results, and proceed with the solution we like the most?</p>
<p>When trying to solve a problem, we also learn more about the problem.</p>
<p>When trying to solve a problem, we should focus on the hardest part of the problem. Or the most unknown part. We should strive to increase our confidence that our solution will work.</p>
