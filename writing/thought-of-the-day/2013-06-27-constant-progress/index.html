<p><em>Published on 27 June 2013.</em></p>

<p>Today’s thought is about constant progress.</p>
<p>TDD is said to enable you to make constant progress. There is always a small test that you can write that takes you in the direction you want to go. If you are unsure about how to proceed, just write a tiny test and keep going from there.</p>
<p>This was not working for me yesterday. In 25 minutes I was not able to make any progress at all. I had written a test that showed some functionality that I desired. Or thought I desired. For me, this particular problem is hard, so knowing what next test to write is not always easy.</p>
<p>When it came to the implementation, it got even harder. I had no idea how to make this test pass in the near future. Perhaps this was caused by me doing TDD wrong and not following the transformation priority premise. Perhaps I was just tired.</p>
<p>When the pomodoro finished, I didn’t feel like I could make any more progress today. At least not in front of the keyboard. But I couldn’t let it go. So I sat down with a pen and piece of paper and thought about the problem. I managed to clarify some things for myself. It felt better.</p>
<p>Next time when I sit down at the computer, maybe I am better equipped to continue solving this problem.</p>
