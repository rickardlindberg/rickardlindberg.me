<p><em>Published on 15 May 2014.</em></p>

<p>Today’s thought is about how I got stuck when refactoring a piece of code.</p>
<p>Yesterday I wanted to refactor a piece of code to make it more clear and easy to read. But I found myself stuck. The problem was not that I was afraid to afraid to break the code if I changed it. I had pretty good test coverage and felt confident that I could quickly verify a change. The problem was that I could not come up with a better way to write the code.</p>
<p>I know how the piece of code works because I wrote it, I did it quite recently, and it is not that long (maybe around 50 lines). But when I read it, it doesn’t immediately express the thoughts I had when I wrote it. It was frustrating to realize that I’ve not expressed my thoughts clear enough and at the same time not be able to do anything about it.</p>
<p>What can I do in situations like this? Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Realize that this is the best I can for now and be happy with that</li>
<li>Discuss with a friend how to improve it</li>
<li>Explain the code in words or pictures to explain it in another format than code</li>
</ul>
