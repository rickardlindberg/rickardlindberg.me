Everyday I sit down for 25 minutes and write down a thought about programming.
Whatever comes out gets published.

My intention is to share thoughts/ideas I have about programming.

A second intention is to practice writing and publishing even though I don't
feel it's 100% complete.

All thoughts can be found in the [archive](http://github.com/rickardlindberg/thought-of-the-day/tree/master/thoughts).
