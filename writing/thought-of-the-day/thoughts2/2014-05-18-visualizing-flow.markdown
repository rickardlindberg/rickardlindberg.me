title: Visualizing program flow
---

A few days ago I explained how a system worked to a college. Or rather, I let a
visualization program do it. The system consists of services that talk to each
other over TCP. The program captured the flow of messages between services
during a test run and visualized them with arrows between nodes.

I found it effective to explain how the system worked by actually **showing**
how the different parts interacted.

A related example is understanding the difference between a recursive function
and an iterative function. When I learned that in school, we drew the call
stack on paper and found that the recursive function generated a triangle shape
whereas the iterative function generated a linear shape. When only reading the
code, you could not immediately see that.

So visualizing how a piece of code works probably works on different levels.
Making visualizations might be useful.
