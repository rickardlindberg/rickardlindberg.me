title: Testability == good design?

Is testability a good heuristic for good design?

I've experienced TDD improve designs. I've also written bad designs for the
purpose of being able to write automated tests. Does that mean that designing
code for testability is a bad heuristic? I don't think so. I still think it's a
good heuristic. When testability leads to bad design I think it's only because
we have not yet found a good way to design a particular solution. One day a new
pattern, paradigm, or idea will be discovered that allows us to write a
testable design that also feels right. In the meantime, we have to make
progress.
