title: State
---

When I write code I want to make as few mistakes as possible. Over time I learn
to avoid patterns that cause more problems than they solve. I learn how to
choose better names to avoid confusion later on.

But state is a little different for me. It is so convenient to solve a problem
by mutating a variable somewhere. Many programming languages are constructed to
make this easy. That's even how many programming languages encourages you to
think about programming. In so many environments, it's so convenient, and
trying to avoid state is much harder.

Perhaps it is a good idea to carefully examine the costs and benefits of using
state in our applications.
