title: Testing as a minimum
---

Yesterday I read a blog post that compared a programmer's activity to a
doctor's.  Apparently doctors didn't wash their hands in between patients, and
when someone concluded that it was a good idea to do so, there was a lot of
resistance among doctors to do it. The post then went on to compare washing
hands to testing in the software world. There is now resistance among
programmers to write test for their code (or for enough of it) even though we
know positive things come out of it. Sometime in the future, will programmers
see washing their hands as critically important?

I like to write tests. Or rather, I like to have tests written. I find code
much more pleasant to work with if I have test that ensure that the code
basically works.

But even I skip writing tests sometimes. Using excuses like I just wanna try
something real quick, it's a so small change, I'll write the code now and test
later. But I think the number one reason why I don't test sometimes is because
it's hard. But if I think about the doctors and their hands, I might try
harder.
