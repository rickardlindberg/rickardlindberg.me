title: Small increments
---

Sometimes I find implementing new features daunting. I feel like the task is
too big and that I will not be able to finish implementing it anytime soon with
proper quality.

That is when it helps for me to think about small increments. It is almost a
challenge to slice the problem in pieces that feels doable. What is the
simplest possible slice that will take me in the direction of the final
feature?

Slicing up a problem also helps my motivation. I'm quite lazy, so there is
resistance towards big amounts of work. But if there is just a single tiny
slice, I can probably do it. And then the next, and next.
