title: Recognizing progress
---

I sometimes enjoy to learn new languages or frameworks. The progress in my
learning is immediate and clear: before I could not write a piece of code in
this environment, and now I can. I must have learned something.

But how do you recognize that you are making progress overall in the
programming field?

One way I used to recognize progress was to think like this: would I feel
comfortable putting my 1-year-ago-self in a programming project. If yes, it's a
sign that I'm not making enough progress. If no, it's a sign that I do.

I used to feel like I wouldn't want to put my 1-year-ago-self in a programming
project. And it felt good because I felt like I learned a lot. It was a while
since I felt that.

I like to believe that I still make progress in my learning about programming.
But I'm not sure how to see it.
