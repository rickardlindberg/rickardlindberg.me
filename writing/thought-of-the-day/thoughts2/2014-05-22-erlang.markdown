title: Erlang
---

Yesterday I began reading a book about Erlang. I learned that an Erlang program
consists of many concurrent processes that communicate by sending messages to
each other.

Then the author surprised me. He compared the Erlang processes to classes in
object-oriented languages, and the act of spawning a process to that of
instantiating a class. It surprised me for two reasons:

- Erlang is a functional language, and one of the firs things I read about are
  similarities with object-oriented languages.

- Processes that communicate by sending messages to each other feel different
  to me than object-oriented programming as we know it today.

Then I thought about Alan Kay and what he originally envisioned object-oriented
programming to be. Perhaps Erlang is the best language to write such programs
in? I have to learn more to find out.
