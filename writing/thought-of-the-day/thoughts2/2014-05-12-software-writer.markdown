After watching [DDH's keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M), I
was inspired to think about what programming has in common with writing. In
particular this resonated with me: In order to get better at writing (and
programming), you should

1. read a lot
2. write a lot
3. rewrite a lot

The first version of of a piece of text (or code) is a **draft**. It is not
going to be perfect. But it will become better and better after **iterations of
improvements**.

Improving a piece of text (or code) often means to express the writing more
clearly to get your ideas across. What makes something clear or not has not so
much to do with science as it has to do with understanding your audience.
