        <h1>Bug free code</h1>
<p>Today’s thought is about bugs.</p>
<p>When developing software, we try to avoid introducing bugs. We test our code to make sure it works. We have bug trackers to remember what bugs got introduced anyway so that we can fix them later. In short, we want our code to be free of bugs.</p>
<p>But is it really that important?</p>
<p>Say we introduce a bug in our program, and the program is put in production. We never hear about the bug from anyone. No one seems to complain. Would it have been better to work harder to prevent the bug from entering production? Maybe not. If no one notices the bug, it might be an indication that a specific part of our application is not needed, and the better thing to do might be to remove it completely. Less code is after all easier to maintain.</p>
