        <h1>Thought of the day</h1>

<p>Thought of the day started out as a series of posts during the summer of 2013. The idea I had was to sit down every day for 25 minutes and write down a thought about programming. Whatever came out got published.</p>
<p>My intention was to share thoughts and ideas I have about programming. A second intention was to practice writing and publishing even though I don’t feel it’s 100% complete.</p>
<p>I continued the series in May 2014, but this time limiting the time to 15 minutes.</p>
