        <h1>Features and bugs</h1>
<p>Today’s thought is about features and bugs.</p>
<p>It is quite common that we categorize our work as either implementing a new feature or fixing a bug. However, when I read about the ZeroMQ project, I learned about a different approach. They view all their work as fixing problems. They make no distinction between features and bugs.</p>
<p>If users of our software can not work the way they want, they have a problem. If we can fix that problem by making some changes to our code, then we have provided some value. It doesn’t matter if we would categorize the change as fixing a bug or implementing a feature. The important thing is that we fixed a problem and provided value.</p>
<p>This approach appeals to me.</p>
<p>The change log of a project like this shows a bunch of things that we can do with the program that we couldn’t do in the previous version.</p>
<p>When end users read a change log, is it important to them to know what bugs were fixed and what new features were implemented? I don’t know. But probably not.</p>
