        <h1>Functional core</h1>

<p><em>Published on 26 May 2014.</em></p>

<p>I continued reading about Erlang this weekend. I read about the sequential part which is functional. It feels like Erlang programs are structured as small functional processes that communicate with message passing. I have to read more about the concurrent part of Erlang to know for sure though.</p>
<p>This feels similar to an approach I read about (I forgot where) when writing classes in object oriented programming: have all private methods be free of side effects. So each class might have a small amount of state that is only modified at the top level, but all the private “helper” methods would be purely functional.</p>
<p>Another thing it feels similar to is <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell">functional core imperative shell</a> by Gary Bernhardt.</p>
<p>Because Erlang is a functional language, it is probably easier to enforce the functional part of such a design. It feels like Erlang is a good fit for writing programs the way some people like to write object oriented programs. Which is a bit strange.</p>
