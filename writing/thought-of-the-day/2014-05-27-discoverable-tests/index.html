<p><em>Published on 27 May 2014.</em></p>

<p>Where do you put your tests so that you can find them with ease? How do you know if a piece of code is covered with tests?</p>
<p>I’m not satisfied with having test in a separate directory. I always struggle with questions like “Should you mirror the source directory?” and “Where do you put test that includes multiple pieces of the codebase?”. It feels more natural to me to store the test together with the implementation. But that doesn’t feel right for tests that include multiple pieces.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way to find the tests for a piece of code is to change the code and see which tests fail. That requires running the whole suit. So it must be relatively fast. In that situation, the exact location of the test is perhaps not that important.</p>
