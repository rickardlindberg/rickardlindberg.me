Today's thought is about resistance to learning.

I feel like there is often a resistance to learning and using new languages and
technologies. Some arguments of resistance:

* If we implement this thing in this new language, everyone has to learn that
  new language, and that will take to much time. It will not be worth it.

* Adding another language to our code base increases the complexity. Having
  everything in one language is better.

* Our customer demands that we write in a specific language.

What if we could allow experimentation? How can we know if using a new language
or technology will be worth it or not? If the only problem turns out to be that
people resist learning new things, can't we solve that problem instead? Maybe
keeping the number of languages down to a minimum is better, but why is it
better?
