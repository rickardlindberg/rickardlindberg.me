Today's thought is about the relation between naming and cohesion.

I just watched a live-streamed hangout initiated by J. B. Rainsberger where the
topic of conversation was coupling and cohesion.

At one point, Dale Emery said something about to naming and cohesion. When you
think about what to name things, you see if they are related or not.

When I heard this I came to think about an exercise I read about where you were
supposed to color a piece of code with three colors: red if you don't
understand it, yellow if you do understand it but it doesn't have anything to
do directly with the problem you are solving, it is infrastructure that makes
your life easier, and green if you understand the code and it deals
directly with the problem you are trying to solve. If you do that you can
try to extract all but the green parts to a different module. Then your
original piece of code will be highly cohesive.
