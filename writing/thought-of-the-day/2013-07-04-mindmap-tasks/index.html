        <h1>Mindmap tasks</h1>
<p>Today’s thought is about using mind maps to keep track of work.</p>
<p>When programming, we often need to keep track of what do do next:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When we pair program, we can’t always do what we think of immediately, so we write it down on a piece of paper to deal with later.</p></li>
<li><p>When we do TDD, we might have a list of tests that we want to write or refactorings we need to do. The list is updated as we go along.</p></li>
<li><p>When we work in scrum teams, we have a backlog of user stories that should get worked on in the future.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All lists. Linear boring lists.</p>
<p>Can we use mind maps to make these lists more interesting and also give us a clearer view of what needs to get done? I think so.</p>
<p>I tried it today at work when working on a task. I broke down the tasks in sub-tasks and wrote them on different branches of the mind map depending on category. As I worked on the items, I came to think of new tasks that I added to the mind map. I worked quite well. I found that it was more clear what I needed to do and when I was finished, and it was definitely more fun than linear lists.</p>
<p>I think mind maps can be used in many contexts in software development.</p>
