title: Thought of the day
---

Thought of the day started out as a series of posts during the summer of 2013.
The idea I had was to sit down every day for 25 minutes and write down a
thought about programming. Whatever came out got published.

My intention was to share thoughts and ideas I have about programming. A second
intention was to practice writing and publishing even though I don't feel it's
100% complete.

I continued the series in May 2014, but this time limiting the time to 15
minutes.
