title: Thought of the day
---

*This is a series of posts I did during the summer of 2013.*

Everyday I sit down for 25 minutes and write down a thought about programming.
Whatever comes out gets published.

My intention is to share thoughts/ideas I have about programming.

A second intention is to practice writing and publishing even though I don't
feel it's 100% complete.
