      <h1>DRAFT: Demo and game idea</h1>

<p><em>Published on 22 April 2023 in <a href="../../projects/agdpp/">Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>This is a work in progress that will change. Like to see it finished? Let me know by sending me an email.</strong></p>
<p>In this episode we demo the “game” for our customer. We get some feedback on it and start evolving the game to meet our customer’s vision.</p>
<h2 id="demo">Demo</h2>
<p>I mentioned to my son that I had started working on a game. He wanted to see it. I told him that there wasn’t much to play yet, but I could show him what it looks like.</p>
<p>I started the “game” and he watched the circle going back and forth.</p>
<p>For reference, this is what the “game” looks like now:</p>
<center>
<img src="animation.png" title="fig:" alt="Animated circle." />
</center>
<p>Then he tried to interact with the circle. He grabbed the mouse and clicked away and was disappointed that nothing happened. I told him that you can’t do anything yet, that it’s just an animation.</p>
<p>He looked at me sad and said “Dad, this game is boring.”</p>
<p>Initially I wasn’t planning on showing him the game because in this early stage there is not much to play, and I knew he was not going to like it. Did I ruin it?</p>
<p>Then I asked him, “What would you like to do with the circle?”</p>
<p>The sadness in his face faded and he started talking about balloons. He said that he wanted the circle to be a balloon and that he wanted to shoot down balloons with arrows.</p>
<p>I think we have an idea for a game.</p>
<h2 id="on-early-feedback">On early feedback</h2>
<p>My initial idea for the game was some kind of tetris variant. I was thinking that you have two boards and that you could help each other out by clearing blocks on each other’s boards. Cooperation seems more fun that competition.</p>
<p>Turns out, the customer wants a balloon shooter. If we hadn’t shown the demo, we might have never found that out.</p>
<h2 id="simplest-possible-version">Simplest possible version</h2>
<p>In the spirit of <a href="https://www.artima.com/articles/the-simplest-thing-that-could-possibly-work#part3">Ward</a> we ask ourselves what the simplest possible balloon shooter could look like. What is the absolute minimum version that I can give to my son and he can somewhat enjoy playing or at least recognize as a balloon shooter?</p>
<p>Here is what I’m thinking:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 balloon falling down the screen</li>
<li>1 arrow pointing in a fixed direction</li>
<li>1 button to shoot that single arrow</li>
<li>Then game over</li>
</ul>
<p>So the only challenge will be to fire the arrow at the right time for it to hit the balloon. You will either hit and get a point or miss and it’ll be game over.</p>
<p>Oh, and circles for the graphics is probably fine. The balloon can be drawn with one big circle, and the arrow maybe with three smaller circles in a row. If I tell my son to imagine they are balloons and arrows, I think he’ll accept that.</p>
<h2 id="first-story">First story</h2>
<p>To make progress towards a balloon shooter, I want to work on a story that is about drawing a balloon and an arrow. Create the initial scene of the game sort of.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Extract <code>Balloon</code></li>
<li>Add <code>Arrow</code></li>
<li>Refactor towards “sprite architecture”
<ul>
<li>reflect on it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Improve drawing</li>
<li>Rename to <code>BalloonShooter</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>We have completed a first vertical slice of our balloon shooter. There is now a balloon and an arrow on the screen. This is new behavior that we could show to our customer and get feedback on. Perhaps he doesn’t like the position of the arrow. If so, we can adjust. Perhaps he can’t imagine that the circles are actually an arrow. If so, we can work on improving the graphics.</p>
<p>What else do we think we need before we have the first version of the balloon shooter?</p>
<ul>
<li>Balloon moves downwards</li>
<li>Balloon respawns when reaching bottom</li>
<li>Arrow animates when shot</li>
<li>New arrow appears after shot</li>
<li>Arrow can burst balloon</li>
<li>Point is given for hit</li>
<li>Real graphics instead of circles</li>
</ul>
<p>Which one is the most important one to work on next? We’ll tackle that one in the next episode!</p>
