    <description><![CDATA[<h1>Introducing Agile Game Development with Python and Pygame</h1>

<p><em>Published on  9 April 2023.</em></p>

<p>I recently started playing computer games with my son. That sparked an interest in me to create a game myself that we can play together. Mostly because I think this will be a <strong>fun project</strong>, but also to show my son that you can actually make your own games. It’s not something that you <em>only</em> consume.</p>
<p>I thought I would also document this journey in a series of blog posts and videos.</p>
<h2 id="video-version">Video version</h2>
<p>The video version of this episode:</p>

</iframe>
</center>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>The challenge is to create a game that me and my son will enjoy playing together.</p>
<h2 id="the-method">The method</h2>
<p>I want to develop this game using Agile methodology.</p>
<p>It means that instead of first figuring out what game I want to write, I will develop it incrementally and guide development by feedback.</p>
<p>It also means that I will rely heavily on self-testing code and TDD.</p>
<h2 id="my-background-in-games">My background in games</h2>
<p>I’m by no means an expert in creating games. I don’t even play games that much. But I have enjoyed creating some simple games in the past, like a Tetris clone and some kind of Asteroids.</p>
<p>I was actually able to restore an old copy of one of my Tetris games. It is written using Python and Pygame (which I also plan to use for my new game). I just needed to make a few small adjustments to make it work with Python 3. This is what it looks like:</p>
<center>
<img src="tetris1.png" title="fig:" alt="Intro screen of my Tetris game." />
</center>
<center>
<img src="tetris2.png" title="fig:" alt="Gameplay screen of my Tetris game." />
</center>
<h2 id="series-overview">Series overview</h2>
<p>So this series will cover how to create a game from the perspective of someone who has much experience programming, but not that much knowledge in the game domain.</p>
<p>Here is a list of topics off the top of my head that I imagine I will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>Game loop and how to test it</li>
<li>Can you really use TDD for games?</li>
<li>Learn to capture events from Logitech controller</li>
<li>How to come up with an idea for a game?</li>
<li>Performance: background erase vs redraw?</li>
<li>Resolution: what to choose?</li>
<li>How to incrementally develop a game idea?</li>
<li>Particle effects</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is just the beginning of my journey. I hope will enjoy following along.</p>
<p>See you in the next episode!</p>

<p><em>After drafting this article, I asked for feedback on <a href="https://discord.com/channels/897648912851173408/897648913799077930/1076788077353246760">James’ Discord</a>. <a href="https://coding-is-like-cooking.info/">Emily</a> <a href="https://discord.com/channels/897648912851173408/897648913799077930/1078285384527650877">wrote</a> back and said that this sounded a lot like pre-tested integration that she had written about (<a href="https://www.eficode.com/blog/pre-tested-integration">here</a> and <a href="https://www.eficode.com/blog/pre-tested-integration2">here</a>) earlier. She describes almost the exact same workflow as I imagine with this CI server, and there is also a Jenkins plugin to support that workflow. I encourage you the check out her writing as well.</em></p>
<p>I think I have figured out what a Continuous Integration (CI) server <em>should</em> do. It is very simple. Yet common tools used for CI, like Jenkins, make it hard or near impossible.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ci">What is CI?</h2>
<p>CI probably means different things to different people.</p>
<p>I’ve tried to find the root of the practice, and a lot of my thoughts here are based on James Shore’s descriptions in <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2/continuous_integration">AOAD2</a>.</p>
<p>So with that in mind, CI to me is about two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Integrate often.</li>
<li>Promise to keep the main branch working at all times.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="what-does-integrate-mean">What does integrate mean?</h2>
<p>Integrate means to merge your changes into the main branch. This branch is commonly also referred to as master or trunk.</p>
<h2 id="how-often-should-you-integrate">How often should you integrate?</h2>
<p>From what I’ve read, the consensus seems to be that you should integrate at least once a day. If you do it less frequently, you are not doing <em>continuous</em> integration.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-the-main-branch-working">How to keep the main branch working?</h2>
<p>Every time you integrate, you have to make sure that the main branch is still working. This is the second aspect of CI.</p>
<p>How can you do that?</p>
<p>The only way to do that, and still integrate often, is with an automatic test suite.</p>
<p>When you integrate your code, you want to run the test suite to make sure that everything still works.</p>
<p><strong>The test suite should give you confidence that when it’s time to deploy to production, it will just work.</strong></p>
<p>I’m using the term test suite here to include everything you need to gain that confidence, so it includes compiling, linting, static analysis, unit tests, deploy to test environment, smoke test… <em>everything</em>.</p>
<h2 id="attitude-not-a-tool">Attitude, not a tool</h2>
<p>James Shore writes that <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2005/continuous-integration-is-an-attitude">Continuous Integration is an Attitude, Not a Tool</a> and points out that <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2006/continuous-integration-on-a-dollar-a-day">you can do CI without a tool</a>.</p>
<p>No tool can choose to integrate your changes often. You have to change your way of working so that you <em>can</em> integrate more often and also do so. This requires practice.</p>
<p>No tool can enforce that your main branch is always working. You have to have a mindset of working like that. This requires practice.</p>
<p>However, there are some things that a tool can help with. To make it easier to work in this way.</p>
<h2 id="ci-server-functionality">CI server functionality</h2>
<p><strong>A CI server should merge changes to the main branch in a “safe” way.</strong></p>
<h3 id="basic-workflow">Basic workflow</h3>
<p>Here is pseudo code for how a CI server should integrate changes from a branch in a Git repo:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">def</span> integrate(repo, branch):</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="cf">with</span> lock(repo):</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>        sh(<span class="st">&quot;git clone </span><span class="sc">{repo}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>        sh(<span class="st">&quot;git merge origin/</span><span class="sc">{branch}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>        sh(<span class="st">&quot;&lt;command to run test suite&gt;&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>        sh(<span class="st">&quot;git push&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The lock step ensures that only one integration can happen at a time. If you have two branches that want to integrate, one has to wait for the other to be integrated first.</p>
<p>The branch is then integrated by performing a <code>git merge</code>.</p>
<p>To make sure the new main branch works, a test suite is then run. This test suite should be defined in the repo.</p>
<p>If the test suite passes, a <code>git push</code> is performed to “publish” the new main branch.</p>
<p>This workflow ensures that every change that is merged into the main branch works. Where “works” is defined as passing the test suite.</p>
<p>That is the basic function that I think a CI server should perform. Let’s look at some directions where this design can be evolved to make a more full fledged CI server.</p>
<h3 id="clean-environments">Clean environments</h3>
<p>One thing that a dedicated CI server helps prevent is the problem that code works on one developer’s machine, but not on another’s. Perhaps it is due to a dependency missing on one developer’s machine.</p>
<p>With a CI server, the one true environment is the CI server’s environment.</p>
<p>Preferably, this should also be set up in the exact same way before every test run so that two test runs have the exact same clean environment.</p>
<p>Clean environments make test runs more predictable and helps make integrations safe.</p>
<p>Setting up a clean environment looks different in different contexts. One option would be to use Docker containers. In the Python world, virtual environments could be set up for each test run.</p>
<p>Any function that a CI server can perform to help set up a clean environment is useful.</p>
<h3 id="multiple-environments">Multiple environments</h3>
<p>Another advantage of a dedicated CI server is that you can make sure that your code works in an environment that you don’t have access to on your development machine.</p>
<p>You might write Python code that should work on both Windows and Linux, but your laptop only runs Windows.</p>
<p>A CI server should have functionality to run the test suite in different environments.</p>
<h3 id="pipeline-language">Pipeline language</h3>
<p>To take full advantage of the CI server, the “command to run the test suite” should be written in a “pipeline language” that the CI server understands.</p>
<p>Consider this pseudo example:</p>
<pre><code>step(&#39;compile&#39;) {
    sh(&#39;make&#39;)
}
parallel {
    step(&#39;test unix&#39;) {
        environment(&#39;unix&#39;) {
            sh(&#39;./test&#39;)
        }
    }
    step(&#39;test windows&#39;) {
        environment(&#39;windows&#39;) {
            sh(&#39;test.exe&#39;)
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This script could not have been written as a Bash script for example, because then it could not have taken advantage of the CI server functionality to run commands in different environments.</p>
<h3 id="objection">Objection!?</h3>
<p>When I asked for feedback on this article, I got some objections about a CI server being responsible for environments and a pipeline language.</p>
<p>One person wrote <a href="https://discord.com/channels/897648912851173408/897648913799077930/1077685040311435314">this</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/897648912851173408/897648913799077930/1078738880653693060">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… having a pipeline script that works <em>only</em> with the ci software seems like a huge lockin and risk</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel that the moment I say I can’t do this locally and I need a pre-configured build server, I am violating the basic principles of development.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I partly agree with those objections.</p>
<p>It would be better if you could run your whole pipeline locally and have it set up all the clean environments for you. With virtualisation technology, this is becoming more and more possible.</p>
<p>If you manage to get this setup, then the CI server only functions as a single integration point that everyone has to go through.</p>
<p>I still think that a pipeline language would be useful for programming your pipeline. However, it could be used outside the CI server as well. That way you could also debug your pipeline locally without involving the CI server. If a pipeline step requires a specific environment that you can’t get locally, that step could be skipped when run locally.</p>
<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>Another aspect of continuous integration is communication.</p>
<p>For example, when you integrate, you want to tell your team members about the change so that they can pull your changes and test their code against it.</p>
<p>A CI server can help communicate. It can for example do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notify the team on a successful integration.</li>
<li>Show today’s integrations in a dashboard to visualize what’s happening.</li>
<li>Show success rate of integrations to give an idea of how the team is doing.</li>
<li>Present clear errors when an integration fails.</li>
<li>Present a clear view of a pipeline and what steps were run.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multiple-test-suites">Multiple test suites</h3>
<p>The lock step in the basic workflow ensures that only one integration can happen at a time.</p>
<p>In some situations you might have a longer running test suite that you don’t want to block further integrations.</p>
<p>A CI server could support that something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">def</span> integrate(repo, branch):</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="cf">with</span> lock(repo):</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>        sh(<span class="st">&quot;git clone </span><span class="sc">{repo}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>        sh(<span class="st">&quot;git merge origin/</span><span class="sc">{branch}</span><span class="st">&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>        sh(<span class="st">&quot;&lt;command to run fast test suite&gt;&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>        sh(<span class="st">&quot;git push&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>    sh(<span class="st">&quot;&lt;command to run slow test suite&gt;&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Of course, when you do this, you risk breaking the main branch since all tests are not run before the change is integrated.</p>
<p>One scenario where this could be useful is if you have a slow running test suite today that you can’t make instantly faster. You can start using this pattern with the goal of making all your slow tests fast. As a rule of thumb, the fast test suite should not take more than 10 minutes. If it takes longer for an integration to complete, chances are that you start multitasking because you don’t want to wait for it.</p>
<p>Some tests might also be impossible to run in less than 10 minutes. In that case, this pattern is also good. But make sure that all basic functionality is tested in the fast test suite.</p>
<h2 id="common-ci-workflows-and-their-problems">Common “CI” workflows and their problems</h2>
<p>When it comes to tools commonly used for CI, I primarily have experience with Jenkins. And the two most common patterns in Jenkins, which a believe are not unique to Jenkins, prevent you from doing continuous integration. Let’s have a look.</p>
<h3 id="run-pipeline-after-commit">Run pipeline after commit</h3>
<p>This pattern runs a pipeline only after you have merged your changes to the main branch.</p>
<p>If the test suite fails, your main branch is broken, and everyone who pulls your changes will base their work on something broken.</p>
<p>If you are serious about continuous integration, you fix this problem immediately. Either by reverting the change or merging a fix. It might not be too big a problem.</p>
<p>If you are not serious about continuous integration, you might leave the main branch broken and hope that someone else fixes it.</p>
<p>With a CI server I describe in this article, it is simply impossible to merge something broken. (Given that your test suite will catch the broken things.)</p>
<h3 id="run-pipeline-on-branch-then-again-after-merge">Run pipeline on branch, then again after merge</h3>
<p>This patterns runs a pipeline on every branch so that you know that your changes work before you merge them. And when you merge them, the pipeline is run again.</p>
<p>This is a slight improvement over the previous pattern, but it still has a flaw. Consider this scenario:</p>
<pre><code>0---0
     \
      \---A
       \
        \---B</code></pre>
<p><code>A</code> and <code>B</code> are two branches that both have passing test suites, so they both go ahead and merge, resulting in this:</p>
<pre><code>0---0-------A&#39;---B&#39;
     \     /    /
      \---A    /
       \      /
        \----B</code></pre>
<p><code>A'</code> has already been tested on the branch, but <code>B'</code> has never been tested. That is, the combination of <code>A</code>’s and <code>B</code>’s changes has never been tested, until they are both merged.</p>
<p>With a CI server I describe in this article, this problem is solved with the lock where multiple integrations have to wait for each other.</p>
<p>If you use the multiple test suites pattern, you still have this problem. At least for functionality only covered by the slow test suite. But then it’s a choice you make. You decide if the trade off is worth it for you or not.</p>
<h2 id="why-dont-tools-for-ci-work-like-this">Why don’t tools for CI work like this?</h2>
<p>I think that tools for CI should help you do CI well. Why don’t they?</p>
<p>I have two speculations.</p>
<p>First, if your team is committed to doing continuous integration, a broken main branch might not be too big a deal since everyone is committed to fixing it fast.</p>
<p>Second, back in the day of using SVN (which was my fist version control system), branching was expensive. The default way to share changes was to push directly to the main branch. Having a CI tool do the actual integration was probably technically more difficult. However, now with Git, that is no longer true.</p>
<p>Do you know why tools for CI don’t work like I describe in this article? Please let me know.</p>
<p>Emily <a href="https://discord.com/channels/897648912851173408/897648913799077930/1078571337989234780">responded</a> the following to that question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think it’s hard to tell at this distance, but I suspect the people building the tools weren’t always the same people who really understood what CI is, and there was a communication gap. The tools that ended up becoming popular were perhaps the easiest to adopt and had the best marketing?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds reasonable to me.</p>
<p>Another person <a href="https://discord.com/channels/897648912851173408/897648913799077930/1077685040311435314">responded</a> with this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i think most [build servers] can be configured that way [proper CI]. many users do not want to because they don’t understand the ci process. instead they regard the build server as some central platform on which development is done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So people find value in build servers even though they are not designed explicitly for CI. That also makes sense.</p>
<p>So perhaps the reason why we don’t have better tools for CI is that people don’t understand the value of CI or don’t want to adopt it?</p>
<h2 id="what-about-pull-requests">What about pull requests?</h2>
<p>Pull requests are a common way of working, but they don’t play nicely together with CI.</p>
<p>First of all, when working with pull requests, you integrate your code by pressing a button that will perform the merge. With a CI tool like the one I describe in this article, the CI tool performs the merge. With the former, no tool can prevent broken code on the main branch. (The best they can do is test the branch, then test again after merge.)</p>
<p>Second of all, pull requests, at least blocking ones, add delay to the process of integrating code, making it difficult to integrate often.</p>
<p>Pull requests are often used to review changes before they are merged. In a CI server that I describe in this article, there is nothing preventing you from having a manual review step before the CI server is allowed to merge. However, a manual review step adds delays and makes it difficult to integrate often.</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>March 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 April 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in March 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I got interested in building a game using <a href="https://www.pygame.org">Pygame</a>. I’ve started playing computer games with my son, so I thought it would be a fun challenge to see if I can build a game that we both enjoy playing. I think this will be my next side project.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/guycIP56YeY">Kent Beck On The FIRST Testing Frameworks, TDD, Waterfall &amp; MORE | The Engineering Room Ep. 16</a>. Listening to Kent Beck is always interesting since many of the practices in the software world come from him.</p></li>
<li><p>I published no programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>. But I suspect upcoming ones will be about agile game development.</p></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>February 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  5 March 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in February 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I started reading <a href="https://joyofagility.com/">Joy of Agility</a>. It has many interesting stories that provide valuable lessons.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued writing my blog post <a href="/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html">What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?</a>. I also asked for feedback on <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/">James’</a> Discord server and got many useful responses. In particular i learned about <a href="https://www.eficode.com/blog/pre-tested-integration">pre-tested integration</a> which looks very similar to what I tried to describe. I will update my blog post with feedback, and then I will call it done.</p></li>
<li><p>I <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@rickardlindberg/109846707922919650">asked Allen Holub</a> how to think about work that is not a story. Agile is about constantly providing value via stories, but what about work that needs to be done that doesn’t fit that category?</p></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>January 2023 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on 11 February 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in January 2023:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I started working on my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/projects">ideal code hosting platform</a>. I’ve attempted to do this once before and failed. I got the urge to give it another try. With my new experience of working in an agile way, I think my chance of succeeding this time is higher. But as always, you need to keep working on the project if it’s not going to die. Anyway, I am happy with the experience of trying and will for sure learn something.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/yXrY5pT88vA">AgileByExample 2021: J.B. Rainsberger - Unlocking the Awesome Power of Refactoring</a>. I learned about the idea of practice. If something you do regularly requires conscious brain effort, practice it until it becomes boring. That frees up brain capacity to think about more high-level problems.</p></li>
<li><p>I started reading <em>Extreme Programming Explained</em> (Second Edition) by Kent Beck. I wanted to learn more about XP since it seems to be the origin of “real” agile. I wanted to learn more about how accurate <a href="https://twitter.com/christianhujer/status/1614888741126176771">this tweet</a> was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>• DevOps is just whole team+CI from XP.<br> • Teaming is whole team+pair programming from XP.<br> • TBD is just CI from XP.<br> • BDD is TDD+ATDD from XP.<br> <br> ⇒ 20+ years later, XP is still leading the way.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>I made some progress on my thinking about continuous integration and have a post about it in progress titled <a href="/writing/what-should-a-ci-server-do/index.html">What should a Continuous Integration (CI) server do?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I published another two programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>December 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  9 January 2023.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in December 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finished writing my blog post <a href="/writing/evolving-design-of-projectional-editor/index.html">How should I evolve the design of my projectional editor?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I studied <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/testing-without-mocks/testing-without-mocks">Testing Without Mocks: A Pattern Language</a> a bit more as James published a draft update of his article. I also watched some episodes of <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/nullables-livestream">Nullables &amp; A-Frame Architecture Livestream</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I got the urge to build a new home for <a href="/projects/timeline/index.html">Timeline</a>. Many years ago a <a href="/writing/new-home-for-timeline/index.html">wrote</a> about what I want from a new home. I have tried building it once before but failed. Now with my updated knowledge of Agile development, I think I might be able to pull it off. (But most likely I will fail again. If I try.)</p></li>
<li><p>I solved Advent of Code <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17">day 17</a> and published my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/aoc/blob/main/2022/17.py">solution</a> on Github.</p></li>

<p>I am writing this blog post to help me get unstuck.</p>
<p>I tried to implement the next thing in my projectional editor and I felt like I had hit the limit of what the design was capable of. There was no way I could add this next thing.</p>
<p>I had to modify the design.</p>
<p>The problem, though, was that I was not able to figure out <em>how</em> to modify the design. I didn’t even know how to move it in the right direction.</p>
<p>So, now I’m writing this blog post to help me find a solution.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I am building a <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlproject">projectional editor</a>. It currently looks like this:</p>
<center>
<img src="rlproject-base.png" title="fig:" alt="My projectional editor." />
</center>
<p>A projectional editor differs from a text editor in that it can project the data structure being edited in different ways. It is not limited to syntax highlighted lines of text for example.</p>
<p>In the screenshot above, you see the same document being projected in two different ways. The first one as multiple lines, and the second one as a single-line string.</p>
<p>The whole editor is created like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>Editor.project(</span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    Split.project([</span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ClipScroll.project(</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>            LinesToTerminal.project(</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>                StringToLines.project(</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>                    String.from_file(path)</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>                )</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true"></a>            ),</span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ),</span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ClipScroll.project(</span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11" aria-hidden="true"></a>            StringToTerminal.project(</span>
<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12" aria-hidden="true"></a>                String.from_file(path)</span>
<span id="cb1-13"><a href="#cb1-13" aria-hidden="true"></a>            ),</span>
<span id="cb1-14"><a href="#cb1-14" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ),</span>
<span id="cb1-15"><a href="#cb1-15" aria-hidden="true"></a>    ])</span>
<span id="cb1-16"><a href="#cb1-16" aria-hidden="true"></a>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Editor.project</code> creates a document that the user can interact with via the GUI. So when the user presses a key on the keyboard, for example, the document responds by modifying itself and returning a new version of itself that the GUI can then render.</p>
<p>The driver for this in the GUI is implemented like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">def</span> on_char(<span class="va">self</span>, evt):</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="va">self</span>.terminal <span class="op">=</span> <span class="va">self</span>.terminal.keyboard_event(KeyboardEvent(</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>        unicode_character<span class="op">=</span><span class="bu">chr</span>(evt.GetUnicodeKey())</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>    ))</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="va">self</span>.repaint_bitmap()</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The document is called <code>self.terminal</code> here because <code>Editor.project</code> creates a document of type <code>Terminal</code>. It contains fragments at given positions that can be displayed in a terminal-like GUI.</p>
<p>The drawing in the GUI looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="cf">for</span> fragment <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="va">self</span>.terminal.fragments:</span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    ...</span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>    memdc.DrawText(fragment.text, fragment.x<span class="op">*</span>char_width, fragment.y<span class="op">*</span>char_height)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Editor</code> adds the status bar that you see in the screenshot on the first line. The rest of the window is filled with the document that is passed to the editor which in turn is created by <code>Split.project</code>. And so on.</p>
<h2 id="the-next-thing-i-wanted-my-editor-to-do">The next thing I wanted my editor to do</h2>
<p>The power of a projectional editor comes from projections, and being able to combine projections in various ways to easily create custom editors for different data structures and scenarios.</p>
<p>The next thing I wanted to try in my editor was to filter the lines in the top split.</p>
<p>Put in other words, I wanted to insert a filter projection in the chain of projections. Something like this (<code>Filter.project</code> added):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb4"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>Editor.project(</span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    Split.project([</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ClipScroll.project(</span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>            LinesToTerminal.project(</span>
<span id="cb4-5"><a href="#cb4-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>                Filter.project(</span>
<span id="cb4-6"><a href="#cb4-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>                    StringToLines.project(</span>
<span id="cb4-7"><a href="#cb4-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>                        String.from_file(path)</span>
<span id="cb4-8"><a href="#cb4-8" aria-hidden="true"></a>                    )</span>
<span id="cb4-9"><a href="#cb4-9" aria-hidden="true"></a>                )</span>
<span id="cb4-10"><a href="#cb4-10" aria-hidden="true"></a>            ),</span>
<span id="cb4-11"><a href="#cb4-11" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ),</span>
<span id="cb4-12"><a href="#cb4-12" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ClipScroll.project(</span>
<span id="cb4-13"><a href="#cb4-13" aria-hidden="true"></a>            StringToTerminal.project(</span>
<span id="cb4-14"><a href="#cb4-14" aria-hidden="true"></a>                String.from_file(path)</span>
<span id="cb4-15"><a href="#cb4-15" aria-hidden="true"></a>            ),</span>
<span id="cb4-16"><a href="#cb4-16" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ),</span>
<span id="cb4-17"><a href="#cb4-17" aria-hidden="true"></a>    ])</span>
<span id="cb4-18"><a href="#cb4-18" aria-hidden="true"></a>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This could be useful in a search and replace scenario for example. Instead of scrolling through the document for matches, you could instead only show the lines that match and make the edit right there. And now you can see how this starts to differ from a plain text editor.</p>
<p>I started working on how to input the text to use in the filter. I came up with this:</p>
<center>
<img src="rlproject-filter.png" title="fig:" alt="New filter input field." />
</center>
<p>The idea is that as you type characters in the filter input field, the lines that do not match get excluded from the top split.</p>
<p>When I made the modification to add the input field, I had to force it in. I didn’t find any clean way to do it using the current design. Forcing it in at first is fine. But I couldn’t find a way to refactor towards a better design either. Furthermore, I was unable to implement the actual filtering part. I just couldn’t figure out how. I was stuck.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-getting-stuck">A note on getting stuck</h2>
<p>When I end up in a stuck situation like this, I wonder if I’m doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Sometimes when I’m reading Agile literature, and maybe TDD literature in particular, I get the feeling that it should always be possible to make progress. Even if just a tiny bit. And if you get stuck, it’s because you ignored earlier signs that you should have refactored or evolved your design in a certain direction.</p>
<p>Well, now I am stuck, and I can’t figure out a test to write to make even tiny progress. So I am turning to my blog for advice and guidance. By writing about the problem, perhaps I can get some clarity and ideas for how to move forward.</p>
<h2 id="a-previous-problem-i-had-noticed">A previous problem I had noticed</h2>
<p>One problem that I had noticed before starting working on filtering lines, but thought was not significant, is partially seen in the creation of the editor:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>Editor.project(</span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    Split.project([</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ClipScroll.project(</span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>            LinesToTerminal.project(</span>
<span id="cb5-5"><a href="#cb5-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>                StringToLines.project(</span>
<span id="cb5-6"><a href="#cb5-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>                    String.from_file(path)</span>
<span id="cb5-7"><a href="#cb5-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>                )</span>
<span id="cb5-8"><a href="#cb5-8" aria-hidden="true"></a>            ),</span>
<span id="cb5-9"><a href="#cb5-9" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ),</span>
<span id="cb5-10"><a href="#cb5-10" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ClipScroll.project(</span>
<span id="cb5-11"><a href="#cb5-11" aria-hidden="true"></a>            StringToTerminal.project(</span>
<span id="cb5-12"><a href="#cb5-12" aria-hidden="true"></a>                String.from_file(path)</span>
<span id="cb5-13"><a href="#cb5-13" aria-hidden="true"></a>            ),</span>
<span id="cb5-14"><a href="#cb5-14" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ),</span>
<span id="cb5-15"><a href="#cb5-15" aria-hidden="true"></a>    ])</span>
<span id="cb5-16"><a href="#cb5-16" aria-hidden="true"></a>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The idea is to create an editor for a file at the given <code>path</code>. This editor provides two projections of this file (one with lines, and one with a string). But the idea is to edit a single file. The different projections give different views of the data structure, but the underlying data structure is the same.</p>
<p>Except, in this case it isn’t. You can see that <code>String.from_file(path)</code> is called twice. And the <code>Split</code> projection forwards key events to both child documents. (Not shown in the code above.) The child documents are actually edited separately, but it looks like they are the same document because they receive the same events and change in the same way.</p>
<p>In most cases, it is probably not useful to have a split that forwards events to all its children. It is probably mostly confusing. I thought that <code>Split</code> would be temporarily useful as way to test multiple projections, and that it could be replaced with something better later on.</p>
<p>But I might have been wrong.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was something more fundamentally wrong with the design here.</p>
<h2 id="making-the-split-work-sensible">Making the split work sensible</h2>
<p>Say we want to modify the <code>Split</code> to only forward events to the top split and have the bottom split be just another view. How would we do that?</p>
<p>First of all, there can be only one document, so something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>document <span class="op">=</span> String.from_file(path)</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>Editor.project(</span>
<span id="cb6-3"><a href="#cb6-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>    Split.project([</span>
<span id="cb6-4"><a href="#cb6-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ClipScroll.project(</span>
<span id="cb6-5"><a href="#cb6-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>            LinesToTerminal.project(</span>
<span id="cb6-6"><a href="#cb6-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>                StringToLines.project(</span>
<span id="cb6-7"><a href="#cb6-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>                    document</span>
<span id="cb6-8"><a href="#cb6-8" aria-hidden="true"></a>                )</span>
<span id="cb6-9"><a href="#cb6-9" aria-hidden="true"></a>            ),</span>
<span id="cb6-10"><a href="#cb6-10" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ),</span>
<span id="cb6-11"><a href="#cb6-11" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ClipScroll.project(</span>
<span id="cb6-12"><a href="#cb6-12" aria-hidden="true"></a>            StringToTerminal.project(</span>
<span id="cb6-13"><a href="#cb6-13" aria-hidden="true"></a>                document</span>
<span id="cb6-14"><a href="#cb6-14" aria-hidden="true"></a>            ),</span>
<span id="cb6-15"><a href="#cb6-15" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ),</span>
<span id="cb6-16"><a href="#cb6-16" aria-hidden="true"></a>    ])</span>
<span id="cb6-17"><a href="#cb6-17" aria-hidden="true"></a>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But this doesn’t help at all. It is because all documents in this design are immutable. So even if we modify <code>Split</code> to only pass events along to the top split, when the second split renders, it will do so with the original version of the document.</p>
<p>What if we create a projection function like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">def</span> create_editor(document):</span>

<span id="cb7-15"><a href="#cb7-15" aria-hidden="true"></a>            ),</span>
<span id="cb7-16"><a href="#cb7-16" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ])</span>
<span id="cb7-17"><a href="#cb7-17" aria-hidden="true"></a>    )</span></code></pre></div>
<p>That way, the same document would always be used.</p>
<p>But creating projections in this way is not possible with the current design.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the driver again to see why:</p>
<pre><code>def on_char(self, evt):
    self.terminal = self.terminal.keyboard_event(KeyboardEvent(
        unicode_character=chr(evt.GetUnicodeKey())
    ))
    self.repaint_bitmap()</code></pre>
<p>In this version, the terminal document returns a new version of itself in the response to a key event. So there is no way to apply the new style projection because it is currently embedded in the document.</p>
<p>What if we write the driver like this instead:</p>
<pre><code>def on_char(self, evt):
    new_document = self.terminal.keyboard_event(KeyboardEvent(
        unicode_character=chr(evt.GetUnicodeKey())
    ))
    self.terminal = create_editor(new_document)
    self.repaint_bitmap()</code></pre>
<p>In this design, we need to supply two things to the driver:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The document to edit</li>
<li>A projection function that projects the document to a terminal document</li>
</ol>
<p>In this design, we can probably modify <code>Split</code> to behave as we want.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-projections-hold-state">How do projections hold state?</h2>
<p>In the current design, there is a slight distinction between a document and a projection, but they are related. Let’s have a look.</p>
<p>Here is what a <code>Terminal</code> document looks like:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb10-1"><a href="#cb10-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">class</span> Terminal(</span>
<span id="cb10-2"><a href="#cb10-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    namedtuple(<span class="st">&quot;Terminal&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;fragments cursors&quot;</span>),</span>
<span id="cb10-3"><a href="#cb10-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>):</span>
<span id="cb10-4"><a href="#cb10-4" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb10-5"><a href="#cb10-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="kw">def</span> print_fragments_and_cursors(<span class="va">self</span>):</span>
<span id="cb10-6"><a href="#cb10-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It has a list of fragments, a list of cursors, and methods that operate on the document.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at a projection from lines to terminal:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb11"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb11-1"><a href="#cb11-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">class</span> LinesToTerminal(</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><a href="#cb11-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    namedtuple(<span class="st">&quot;LinesToTerminal&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;projection lines&quot;</span>),</span>
<span id="cb11-3"><a href="#cb11-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>    Projection</span>
<span id="cb11-4"><a href="#cb11-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>):</span>
<span id="cb11-5"><a href="#cb11-5" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb11-6"><a href="#cb11-6" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="at">@staticmethod</span></span>
<span id="cb11-7"><a href="#cb11-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="kw">def</span> project(lines):</span>
<span id="cb11-8"><a href="#cb11-8" aria-hidden="true"></a>        ...</span>
<span id="cb11-9"><a href="#cb11-9" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span class="cf">return</span> LinesToTerminal(</span>
<span id="cb11-10"><a href="#cb11-10" aria-hidden="true"></a>            ...</span>
<span id="cb11-11"><a href="#cb11-11" aria-hidden="true"></a>        )</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It has a projection (the terminal document), a lines document (which was used as input), and a <code>project</code> function.</p>
<p>It is used something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb12"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb12-1"><a href="#cb12-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>terminal <span class="op">=</span> LinesToTerminal.project(lines)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It projects a lines document to a terminal document. So the input to the <code>project</code> function is a <code>Lines</code> document and the output is a <code>Terminal</code> document.</p>
<p>Except the <code>project</code> function returns an instance of itself, a <code>LinesToTerminal</code>. What’s going on?</p>
<p>Notice the second base class to <code>LinesToTerminal</code>: <code>Projection</code>. It looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">class</span> Projection:</span>
<span id="cb13-2"><a href="#cb13-2" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb13-3"><a href="#cb13-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="at">@property</span></span>
<span id="cb13-4"><a href="#cb13-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>    <span class="kw">def</span> fragments(<span class="va">self</span>):</span>
<span id="cb13-5"><a href="#cb13-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>        <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="va">self</span>.projection.fragments</span>
<span id="cb13-6"><a href="#cb13-6" aria-hidden="true"></a></span>
<span id="cb13-7"><a href="#cb13-7" aria-hidden="true"></a>    ...</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It adds methods to <code>LinesToTerminal</code> so that it behaves like <code>Terminal</code> document even though it is not. (It assumes that the <code>Terminal</code> document is stored in the <code>projection</code> field.)</p>
<p>So why can’t we just return a <code>Terminal</code> document?</p>
<p>Because the projection needs to hold some state. In this case it holds a copy of the <code>Lines</code> document that was passed as input. It needs that to be able to handle events appropriately. (I think this state is what <a href="https://github.com/projectured/projectured/wiki/Projection">ProjecturEd</a> calls an IO map.)</p>
<p>Needing this wrapper <code>Projection</code> to make “projection objects” behave as document objects annoys me.</p>
<p>Can we invert it? What if all documents had an extra field, called <code>meta</code> maybe, that projections could use to store whatever they need to appropriately handle events? That would require all documents to have such a field, but then the wrapper would not be needed and code would be a bit more clean.</p>
<h2 id="ideas-to-move-forward-with">Ideas to move forward with</h2>
<p>Writing this blog post has yielded some results.</p>
<p>Now I have two ideas to move forward with:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Move projection state to documents</li>
<li>Change event driver to make events return a new version of the document being edited instead of a projection</li>
</ol>
<p>How can I make tiny progress on any of the two ideas?</p>
<p>Changing how the driver works seems like a big task that is hard to do in small steps. But moving projection state to documents seems like something that could quite easily be done.</p>
<h2 id="moving-projection-state-into-documents">Moving projection state into documents</h2>
<p>There are currently 3 types of documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>String</li>
<li>Lines</li>
<li>Terminal</li>
</ul>
<p>I decide to start with <code>String</code> to test out this idea. I change</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">class</span> String(</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    namedtuple(<span class="st">&quot;String&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;string selections&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb14-3"><a href="#cb14-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>):</span></code></pre></div>
<p>to</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="kw">class</span> String(</span>
<span id="cb15-2"><a href="#cb15-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    namedtuple(<span class="st">&quot;String&quot;</span>, <span class="st">&quot;meta string selections&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb15-3"><a href="#cb15-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>):</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Immediately tests break because I have not supplied the <code>meta</code> field anywhere. I supply <code>None</code> as a value in all cases, and now everything is back to green.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are no projections to <code>String</code>, so there are no projections that would have use for this new <code>meta</code> field. Bad first choice. Never mind.</p>
<p>I do the same change to <code>Lines</code> instead. It turns out to be even easier since I already had factory method and only needed to modify that in one place.</p>
<p>There is only one projection that projects to <code>Lines</code>, and that is <code>StringToLines</code>. I modify it to store its state in the <code>meta</code> field of the <code>Lines</code> document instead of in the projection by changing this</p>
<pre class="pyton"><code>class StringToLines(
    namedtuple(&quot;StringToLines&quot;, &quot;projection string&quot;),
    Projection
)

    ...
    @staticmethod
    def project(string):
        return StringToLines(
            projection=Lines.create(
                lines=(line[0] for line in lines),
                selections=selections
            ),
            string=string,
        )</code></pre>
<p>to this</p>
<pre class="pyton"><code>class StringToLines(Lines):

    ...
    @staticmethod
    def project(string):
        return StringToLines.create(
            lines=(line[0] for line in lines),
            selections=selections,
            meta=Meta(string=string)
        )</code></pre>
<p>The <code>Meta</code> class is defined like this:</p>
<pre class="pyton"><code>class Meta(
    namedtuple(&quot;Meta&quot;, &quot;string&quot;)
):
    pass</code></pre>
<p>Notice the change in base class. A <code>StringToLines</code> projection is now of type <code>Lines</code>. It <em>is</em> a <code>Lines</code> document. It does not need to add wrappers to act like one.</p>
<p>Why return a <code>StringToLines</code> at all? Why not just return <code>Lines</code>? Because it needs to override methods to handle events. Projections need to implement unique event handles because they handle events differently. But the data that the event handlers need to properly handle events are now stored in the <code>meta</code> field of the document.</p>
<p>I realize that storing the projection state in the document <code>meta</code> field or in the projection wouldn’t matter. Different event handlers would need to be associated with different projections anyway.</p>
<p>I’m not sure we are much closer to solving the problem of a sane split view, but I think storing state in documents provides a slightly cleaner design (<a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlproject/compare/1ab0ca6f57f33318fc87aa9c9913189cf08c99d3...df15b3f663855cd5e54c3b711e9a042afeee96fa">complete diff</a>), so it should help us think a bit more clearly.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-store-editor-state">Where to store editor state?</h2>
<p>The next thing to try is to change the behavior of event handlers to return a new version of the document being edited instead of a new projection. The document can then be converted to a <code>Terminal</code> document using the projection function which in turn can be rendered by the GUI.</p>
<p>The new <code>meta</code> field might come in handy here.</p>
<p>Let’s explore.</p>
<p>In our target design, the driver looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>def on_char(self, evt):
    new_document = self.terminal.keyboard_event(KeyboardEvent(
        unicode_character=chr(evt.GetUnicodeKey())
    ))
    self.terminal = create_editor(new_document)
    self.repaint_bitmap()</code></pre>
<p>Say that the document is a <code>String</code> and that it is read from a file. The <code>create_editor</code> function is completely stateless, so all information about how to render this document through a series of projections must be contained in the document. But a <code>String</code> document has no information about the editor. And the editor would for sure need some state unrelated to the document. One such state would be if the filter input dialog should be shown or not. Another might be which projection to use. Imagine that you can press a key to cycle through different projections for example. The one chosen must be stored somewhere.</p>
<p>We can use the new <code>meta</code> field for this.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-is-this-going-to-take">How long is this going to take?</h2>
<p>I feel like I’ve done a lot of work, and I’m still not confident that this is a good way forward. I feel like I keep trying things and just run into new problems.</p>
<p>I’m trying to think 10 steps ahead to see if the new design will serve all the things that I potentially want to do. I end up just thinking without actually doing anything. Perhaps I shouldn’t. Perhaps I should just focus on the next thing, and then, eventually, I will have reached my end goal. I guess that is the TDD way of doing it. One tiny test at a time. At least now, I have a direction to try. I know one test to write.</p>
<p>But I’m frustrated that I can’t clearly see how this new design will solve even my immediate problems.</p>
<p>But my confidence is starting to grow that this is a promising direction.</p>
<h2 id="switching-event-driver-safely">Switching event driver safely</h2>
<p>We can’t just change how the event driver works in a small step. It would require changes in many places.</p>
<p>What we can do is do a completely parallel implementation of event handlers. We can test drive those, and when we are confident that they work, we can switch over to use them in the driver and remove the old event handlers.</p>
<p>I start with this test:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb20"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb20-1"><a href="#cb20-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> project, document <span class="op">=</span> Editor.create_projection_document(<span class="st">&quot;rlproject.py&quot;</span>)</span>
<span id="cb20-2"><a href="#cb20-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> terminal <span class="op">=</span> project(document)</span>
<span id="cb20-3"><a href="#cb20-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">isinstance</span>(terminal, Terminal)</span>
<span id="cb20-4"><a href="#cb20-4" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="va">True</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>Editor.create_projection_document</code> is a completely new function. It returns a projection function and a document. This is what the new event driver requires.</p>
<p>I add another test:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb21"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb21-1"><a href="#cb21-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> document <span class="op">=</span> terminal.new_size_event(SizeEvent(<span class="dv">10</span>, <span class="dv">10</span>))</span>
<span id="cb21-2"><a href="#cb21-2" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="op">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="bu">isinstance</span>(document, String)</span>
<span id="cb21-3"><a href="#cb21-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="va">True</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>This test uses the 2 things like the event driver would. It sends an event to the projection (<code>terminal</code>) and receives a new version of the document being edited (<code>document</code>). The assert checks that we get back a document of the correct type.</p>
<p>The event is called <code>new_size_event</code>. The old one is called <code>size_event</code>. Here the parallelism comes in. We have to duplicate event handlers because they have different signatures.</p>
<p>I am interested in getting some feedback if the new event driver will actually work for real, so I make it possible to use the new driver via a GUI flag:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb22"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb22-1"><a href="#cb22-1" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="cf">if</span> <span class="st">&quot;--new-style-driver&quot;</span> <span class="kw">in</span> sys.argv[<span class="dv">1</span>:]:</span>
<span id="cb22-2"><a href="#cb22-2" aria-hidden="true"></a>    driver <span class="op">=</span> Editor.create_driver(path)</span>
<span id="cb22-3"><a href="#cb22-3" aria-hidden="true"></a><span class="cf">else</span>:</span>
<span id="cb22-4"><a href="#cb22-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>    driver <span class="op">=</span> Editor.from_file(path)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This of course does not work fully, but it actually uses the new driver to project something on the screen! I’m starting to feel more confidence in the solution as I can test it for real.</p>
<p>I’m not there yet tho. All events are not fully implemented. I write more tests for those and then try them in the GUI to get the satisfaction of seeing the changes actually work.</p>
<p>I get so excited that I fix some things without writing tests for them. I just check them in the GUI. That’s fine. At least I get quick feedback.</p>
<p>Then I reach a point where the new version is as functional as the old one. It actually works!</p>
<p>I remove the GUI flag and the old event driver implementation and clean up the code base a bit.</p>
<p>I can now also see how to proceed with filtering lines and how that would work in this new design. I’m unstuck!</p>
<h2 id="was-a-blog-post-necessary">Was a blog post necessary?</h2>
<p>The blog post forced me to explain things so that it would be clear to someone else. It forced me to think more clearly.</p>
<p>By doing so, I noticed a problem in the code and a possible way forward.</p>
<p>I don’t think I could have done that using TDD only.</p>
<p><strong>Maybe writing was my way of listening to the code.</strong> It was my way of thinking of what test to write next. Writing made it more clear in what direction to move, then TDD helped me move in that direction safely and steadily.</p>
<p>On the other hand, thinking is not forbidden in TDD. And if writing gives better thinking, is it thinking or writing?</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>November 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 December 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in November 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued programming on my <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlproject">projectional editor</a>. I had so many ideas I wanted to try, but I got stuck with the design. I started writing a <a href="/writing/evolving-design-of-projectional-editor/index.html">blog post</a> explaining the problem. The blog post helped me get unstuck and I was able to move forward with my ideas.</p></li>
<li><p>I struggled with my writing in the before mentioned blog post. I got a <a href="https://hachyderm.io/@estherschindler/109424345364034217">tip</a> to read a book called “Bird by Bird”. It is a bit unlike other books I usually read in that it paints a picture of what it is like to be a writer. It doesn’t just give you the facts how to become a (better) writer. Sometimes I enjoy it and sometimes I just want the facts.</p></li>
<li><p>I created a Mastodon account to explore this other federated version of microblogging. You can find me at <a

<p><em>Published on 10 November 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in October 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I started exploring projectional editing with <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlproject">rlproject</a>. For now, I’m trying to implement something like what <a href="https://github.com/projectured/projectured/wiki">ProjecturEd</a> describes in its documentation to learn how that might work.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/8Ab3ArE8W3s">“Stop Writing Dead Programs” by Jack Rusher (Strange Loop 2022)</a>. It showed what a better development environment might look like. It also showed that a projectional editor might make your program feel more alive than a plain text editor. Hillel Wayne <a href="https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/strangeloop-22/">points out</a> that the talk has factual errors. Nevertheless, I found it inspiring.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/Fk4rCn4YLLU">End to end functional tests that can run in milliseconds | Nat Pryce | CukenFest London 2017</a>. Nat showed an interesting approach to testing you application in a flexible way.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/9fJntxnH4wY">Pairin’ with Aaron: Messing with Language Servers</a>. I learned about languages servers (LPS’s) and their integration with the development environment.</p></li>
<li><p>I watched some episodes of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgt1lVMrdwlZKBaerxxp2iQ">Mob Mentality Show</a> and found them interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another four programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>September 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  8 October 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in September 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I finally finished writing <a href="/writing/reliable-socket-servers/index.html">How to write reliable socket servers that survive crashes and restarts?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/ulRCs7xQA74">Continuous Delivery vs. Gitflow &amp; CD At Scale | Bryan Finster In The Engineering Room Ep. 11</a>. In it, Bryan mention a metaphor with flying cards. The idea was that it is difficult to explain the concept of a flying car to someone who has never experienced it. It’s too foreign. I thought about how I could expose people to more “flying cars”. Make them experience TDD, CI/CD, etc, so that they never wanting to go back.</p></li>
<li><p>I think it was also in the video above that Dave said something along the lines that it’s amazing how much you start caring about testing if you are the one on call. That resonated with me. If you are responsible, you start caring. It also reminded me of another concept about how much to test, where the advice was something like test until fear turns into boredom. (I think I read it from <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrains">jbrains</a>, but <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrains/status/663451314341416960">it seems</a> to originally be from someone else.)</p></li>

    <title>August 2022 Update</title>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>August 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  9 September 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in August 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I was interested in learning more how to slice stories to make them smaller but still valuable. I found Ron’s article <a href="https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/getting-small-stories/">Getting Small Stories</a> very useful. Having one “dumb” idea can change the conversation from “that is impossible” to “how can we make it better”.</p></li>
<li><p>I also read Ron’s book <a href="https://pragprog.com/titles/rjnsd/the-nature-of-software-development/">The Nature of Software Development</a>. In it he talks about focusing on value and that value is something that <em>we want</em>. But who is <em>we</em>? When I am working on software that I use, I can ask myself what I want. But in most cases I’m not the only user of the software that I write. <em>We</em> are probably many different people.</p></li>
<li><p>I’ve though about writing a book about how to implement programming languages. It would use <a href="/projects/rlmeta/index.html">RLMeta</a> for the examples. But writing a book seems like a daunting task. I started thinking that I could approach writing the book the same way I approach writing software in an agile fashion with small stories. I can create the first version of the “book” in one day. Then I can improve it by writing more chapters and going into more details.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued writing <a href="/writing/reliable-socket-servers/index.html">How to write reliable socket servers that survive crashes and restarts?</a></p></li>
<li><p>I watched the Mob Mentality Show <a href="https://youtu.be/nLUFPHUS2Pk">Agile vs. Agility with Allen Holub</a>. I’ve been inspired by Allen’s talk about Agile, and I got value from this episode.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another four programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/BXyiqhqXT0U">I did the simplest thing that could possibly work. Here’s what happened.</a></li>

<p>A few months ago, I was researching how to do zero-downtime deployments and found the wonderful blog post <a href="https://alangrow.com/blog/dream-deploys-atomic-zero-downtime-deployments">Dream Deploys: Atomic, Zero-Downtime Deployments</a>.</p>
<p>In it, Alan describes how separating listening on a socket and accepting connections on it into different processes can keep a socket “live” at all times even during a restart.</p>
<p>In this blog post I want to document that trick and my understanding of it.</p>

<p>This is a TCP server, listening on port 9000, reading numbers from clients, and returning the product of the two numbers. It assumes that numbers can be parsed as integers. If parsing fails, the server crashes.</p>

<p>It sends 20 requests to the server with a 10ms delay between them. However, for request with number 5, instead of sending the number <code>5</code> it sends the string <code>five</code> to cause the server to crash.</p>

<p>In the client output, we see that request with number 5 never receives a response from the server and that subsequent requests fail because the server has crashed, and there is no one listening on port 9000.</p>
<h2 id="solution-restart-the-server-in-a-loop">Solution: restart the server in a loop</h2>
<p>In order for subsequent requests to succeed, we need to start the server again after it has crashed. One way to do that is to run the server program in an infinite loop using a script like the one below:</p>

<p>In the server output, we see that the server starts again after the crash and starts listening on port 9000.</p>
<p>In the client output, we see that request with number 5 fails the same way, but after a few more requests, it starts getting responses again at request with number 14.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-a-restarting-server">The problem with a restarting server</h2>
<p>Running the server in a loop is an improvement. Instead of dropping all subsequent requests, we only drop a few.</p>
<p>But during the time between the server crash and a new server being up, there is no one listening on port 9000 and we still drop connections.</p>
<p>How can we make sure to handle all requests?</p>
<h2 id="solution-separate-listening-on-a-socket-and-accepting-connections">Solution: separate listening on a socket and accepting connections</h2>
<p>The trick, as also demonstrated in Alan’s blog post, is to listen on the socket in one process and accept connections and processing requests in another process. That way, if processing fails, and that process dies, the socket still stays open because it is managed by another process.</p>
<p>Here is a program that listens on a socket and then spawns server processes in a loop to accept connections:</p>

<p>The first part of this program creates a socket and starts listening. This is what we had in the previous example.</p>
<p>The second part moves the file descriptor of the socket to file descriptor 0 (stdin) to make it available to child processes.</p>
<p>The third part replaces the current process with <code>bash loop.sh python server-accept.py</code>. At this point the process is listening on the socket and starts the <code>server-accept.py</code> program in a loop. As long as the <code>loop.sh</code> script doesn’t exit, there will be someone listening on port 9000.</p>
<p>The <code>server-accept.py</code> program is similar to <code>server-listen.py</code>, but instead of listening on port 9000, it just accepts connections on the socket which is passed to it as file descriptor 0 (stdin):</p>
<p>Here is <code>server-accept.py</code>:</p>

<p>Now all requests (except the one that causes a crash) get a response. We see that request with number six takes longer to complete. That is because <code>server-accept.py</code> needs time to start up (by the loop script) and call <code>accept</code> on the socket. But the request doesn’t fail. The client will not get a connection error.</p>
<p>And this is one way to write reliable socket servers that survive crashes and restarts.</p>

<p>The client output looked like this:</p>
<div class="rliterate-code">
<div class="rliterate-code-header">

<span class="cp">client output </span>

6*6=36 (request took 60123ms)
7*7=49 (request took 0ms)
...
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>So it seems that the client got no errors even though the request took 60 seconds to be responded to.</p>
<p>I suppose you can put a timeout in the client code. But this question was about how long the operating system on the server will keep the connection “alive” even though no one calls <code>accept</code>.</p>
<p>I suppose the operating system has some kind of buffer. Say that there are multiple clients making requests at the same time and the server never calls <code>accept</code> during that time. Eventually some buffer must be exceeded and connections get dropped.</p>
<p>(It seems that the client hangs on the <code>s.recv</code> call. That means that the request was sent to the server and must have filled up some buffer.)</p>
<p>If anyone can point me to documentation where I can read about this behavior, please drop me a line.</p>
<h3 id="can-we-decrease-the-startup-time">Can we decrease the startup time?</h3>
<p>When the loop script restarts the server, it takes ~100ms for it to come up and process requests. How can we decrease that time?</p>
<p>One way would be to modify the loop script to spawn multiple server processes. That way, if one crashes, the other can serve the next request.</p>
<p>This would also make the server code concurrent. That is, no “global” state can reside in the server process, because we don’t know which server process will serve the next request.</p>
<p>Another solution might be to have a second process in standby mode. So the loop script starts a second server process, but it stops it right before calling accept. But then we would need a way to signal to the process to resume operation. Perhaps by sending it a signal?</p>

<p>Both of these make the loop script more complicated. And if it gets more complicated, it is more likely to crash. And if it crashes, the socket gets closed, and subsequent requests will get connection errors.</p>
<h3 id="can-we-use-this-technique-to-create-a-load-balancer">Can we use this technique to create a load balancer?</h3>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>If the loop script spawns multiple server processes, the operating system will load balance between them.</p>
<p>No fancy load balancing software needed.</p>

<p>We do that to make the file descriptor available to child processes so that they can create a socket using it and then call <code>accept</code>.</p>
<p>In Python, the file descriptor of the socket is <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#fd-inheritance">not inheritable by default</a>. That is, a child process will not be able to access the socket file descriptor. That is why we have to move it to file descriptor 0 (stdin) which is inherited.</p>

<p>Why do we do that?</p>
<p>I did it because that is how <a href="https://github.com/acg/dream-deploys/blob/master/tcplisten">Alan did it</a>. But now that I think about it, I think we can just as well inline the loop script in <code>server-listen-loop.py</code>. That, of course, requires the loop script to be written in Python. Something like this:</p>
<div class="rliterate-code">
<div class="rliterate-code-header">
<ol class="rliterate-code-path">

</div>
</div>
<p>It seems to work as well.</p>
<p>If the loop script is a simple loop like this, perhaps it makes sense to inline it. But if the loop script is more complex, perhaps even a third party product to manage server processes, it makes sense to do the <code>execvp</code>.</p>
<h3 id="why-socket-option-reuse">Why socket option REUSE?</h3>
<p>In <code>server-listen.py</code>, we set the socket option <code>SO_REUSEADDR</code>:</p>

</div>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/3229926">this Stackoverflow answer</a> explains it well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This socket option tells the kernel that even if this port is busy (in the TIME_WAIT state), go ahead and reuse it anyway. If it is busy, but with another state, you will still get an address already in use error. It is useful if your server has been shut down, and then restarted right away while sockets are still active on its port.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without it, it can not be run in a loop, and will get this error:</p>
<pre><code>OSError: [Errno 98] Address already in use</code></pre>
<h3 id="is-this-how-supervisor-works">Is this how Supervisor works?</h3>
<p><a href="http://supervisord.org/">Supervisor</a> can create a process that listens on a socket and then pass that socket to child processes. For example like this:</p>
<pre><code>[fcgi-program:test]
socket=tcp://localhost:9000
command=python server-accept.py</code></pre>
<p>The <code>server-accept.py</code> program will get a socket passed to it as file descriptor 0 (stdin).</p>
<p>However, if <code>server-accept.py</code> crashes, it seems like Supervisor closes the socket and creates it again upon restart:</p>
<pre><code>2022-05-10 21:46:28,734 INFO exited: test (exit status 1; not expected)
2022-05-10 21:46:28,734 INFO Closing socket tcp://localhost:9000
2022-05-10 21:46:29,736 INFO Creating socket tcp://localhost:9000
2022-05-10 21:46:29,737 INFO spawned: &#39;test&#39; with pid 561624
2022-05-10 21:46:30,740 INFO success: test entered RUNNING state, process has stayed up for &gt; than 1 seconds (startsecs)</code></pre>
<p>So in this setup, we would still drop connections.</p>
<h3 id="why-not-make-the-server-more-reliable">Why not make the server more reliable?</h3>
<p>We could make the server more reliable so that it doesn’t crash. But sometimes a server needs to be restarted anyway. For example when configuration changes or a new version of the server should be deployed. The approach described in this blog post makes it possible to do those kinds of things without ever dropping connections as well.</p>
<h3 id="can-this-approach-be-used-for-zero-downtime-deployments">Can this approach be used for zero-downtime deployments</h3>
<p>Well, yes, that is how I learned about it in <a href="https://alangrow.com/blog/dream-deploys-atomic-zero-downtime-deployments">Alan’s blog post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="can-we-use-a-unix-domain-socket-instead-of-a-tcp-socket">Can we use a Unix domain socket instead of a TCP socket?</h3>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>In fact, the accepting server doesn’t know what kind of socket is passed to it. It could be either a Unix domain socket or a TCP socket:</p>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>July 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  2 August 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in July 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I continued practicing Agile software development with <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlci/">RLCI</a>. I slowly get the feeling that Agile is not really what most people think it is. Some things I read and watched this month in that vein:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1546604233323032576">few</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1552432052762320896">tweets</a> by Allen Holub and a <a href="https://youtu.be/hxXmTnb3mFU">conversation</a> he had with Dave Farley gave me some insights into what “real” Agile is about.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.sicpers.info/2022/07/phrases-in-computing-that-might-need-retiring/">Phrases in computing that might need retiring</a> by Graham Lee indicated to me that the term “Agile” has changed meaning over the years.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.ronjeffries.com/articles/-z022/0222ff/gotta-be-good/">Gotta Be Good</a> by Ron Reffries indicated to me that “real” Agile is actually HARD and need to be practiced to get good at.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I published another five programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/d7fq8JyU9jg">How to write tests that allow refactoring your code?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/BmUz4my7eko">Deploying my continuous integration software to a server.</a></li>

    <title>June 2022 Update</title>
    <link>http://rickardlindberg.me/writing/newsletter/june-2022/</link>
    <description><![CDATA[<h1>June 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  4 July 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in June 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I started over with <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlci/">RLCI</a> and tried to build it using an agile approach. The README has a bunch of more information about it. In this process, the following resources helped me:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2018/testing-without-mocks">Testing Without Mocks: A Pattern Language</a> Again from James Shore. Gave me insight into how to design and test.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/you-dont-hate-mocks-you-hate-side-effects">You Don’t Hate Mocks; You Hate Side-Effects</a> The following quote explained it well to me the design relationship between pure functions and functions with side effects:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We always have the option of replacing a side-effect with returning a value that represents the effect, as long as we can instruct the clients to interpret that value as a command to execute.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/01/03/favor-real-dependencies-for-unit-testing/">Favor real dependencies for unit testing</a> This helped me solve a testing problem I had. More on that in an upcoming video.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I discovered that one of the authors of <em>Continuous Delivery</em>, Dave Farley, has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ContinuousDelivery">Youtube channel</a>. I found some of his videos interesting.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another four programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/yKkGXn1zmaI">How James Shore ruined my RLCI project.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Re7litDdulU">Rebooting RLCI with an agile approach using TDD and zero friction development.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/sokSvnAkd5E">Adding continuous integration functionality to RLCI.</a></li>

    <description><![CDATA[<h1>May 2022 Update</h1>

<p><em>Published on  4 June 2022.</em></p>

<p>This is what I’ve been up to in May 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I rediscovered James Shore through his <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2/book_club/evolutionary_design">Agile Book Club: Evolutionary Design (with Kent Beck)</a>. I had stumbled upon his <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/projects/lunch-and-learn">TDD Lunch &amp; Learn</a> series before, and the book club made me revisit some of his work. This time I also bought his book <a href="https://www.jamesshore.com/v2/books/aoad2">The Art of Agile Development</a> which reignited my interest for agile methods (something that has diminished more and more since I first got into it).</p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="https://alangrow.com/blog/dream-deploys-atomic-zero-downtime-deployments">Dream Deploys: Atomic, Zero-Downtime Deployments</a> and got inspired to try that approach. I also started working on a <a href="/writing/reliable-socket-servers/index.html">blog post</a> on my own to explore the topic.</p></li>
<li><p>I continued working on <a href="https://github.com/rickardlindberg/rlci/">RLCI</a> and worked on connecting the different pieces. However, after getting inspired by agile methods again and learning that continuous integration is not what I thought it was (thanks for the inspiration James!), I will have to rethink the project. I think I will start over from scratch and develop it with a slightly new approach.</p></li>
<li><p>I published another four programming videos on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XI09URnsM_YYTSizAMliA">Youtube channel</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/R-HCtiVzYuI">Connecting all the pieces in RLCI.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/BQ-wWIVQ_gs">Researching zero downtime deployments.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/S_R80ZhsmZo">Getting back to the roots of TDD.</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/Xm8QGMzyxeI">Practicing TDD and testing without mocks.</a></li>
</ul></li>
