title: RLMeta

<p>RLMeta is a programming language in which you write grammars. Grammars have
rules that specify how to match objects from an input stream and specify what
should happen when objects are matched. It can be used to write lexers,
parsers, tree transformers, code generators, and similar tools. The RLMeta
compiler is implemented in RLMeta itself which makes it a metacompiler.</p>
